The teaching of mathematics in France was dominated by a handful of dogmatic mathematicians hiding behind the pseudonym “Bourbaki”, named after the 19th-century French general, Nicholas Bourbaki. It was an inside joke. The name appealed to the members because it sounded strange and attractive. Although Bourbaki met in secret, they influenced mathematical thinking, not just in France, but throughout Europe

It’s helpful to think of these four parameters — a, b, c, T — as four knobs we can turn to adjust various features of the sine wave’s shape and location. The b-knob moves the sine wave up or down. The c-knob moves it left or right. The T-knob controls how rapidly it oscillates. And the a-knob determines how pronounced those oscillations are. If we could somehow set the knobs to make the sine wave go through

With them, he could do integrals, find roots of algebraic equations, and calculate the values of non-algebraic functions like sines, cosines, and logarithms.

Punching in 2.001 and hitting the x3 button gives (2.001)3 = 8.012006001. The structure to notice is that the extra bit after the decimal point is really three extra bits of very different sizes: .012006001 = .012 + .000006 + .000000001. Think of this as small plus super-small plus super-super-small. We can understand the structure we’re seeing by working with algebra. Suppose a quantity x (played here by the number 2) changes slightly to x + Δx (in this case, becoming 2.001). The symbol Δx denotes the difference in x, meaning a tiny change in x (here, Δx = 0.001). Then, when we ask what (2.001)3 is, we are really asking what (x + Δx)3 is. Multiplying it out (or using Pascal’s triangle or the binomial theorem), we find that (x + Δx)3 = x3 + 3x2Δx + 3x(Δx)2 + (Δx)3. For our problem where x = 2, this equation becomes (2 + Δx)3 = 23 + 3(2)2(Δx) + 3(2)(Δx)2 + (Δx)3 = 8 + 12Δx + 6(Δx)2 + (Δx)3. Now we see why the extra bit beyond 8 consists of three bits of different sizes. The small but dominant bit is 12Δx = 12(.001) = .012. The remaining bits 6(Δx)2 and (Δx)3 account for the super-small .000006 and the super-super-small .000000001. The more factors of Δx there are in a bit, the smaller it is. That’s why the bits are graded in size. Every additional multiplication by the tiny factor Δx makes a small bit even smaller. The key insight behind differential calculus is displayed right here in this humble example. In many problems of cause and effect, dose and response, input and output, or any other sort of relationship

approaches zero. But what is it in terms of differentials? It’s simply dy/dx. It’s as if the curve is made up of little straight pieces: If we think of dy as an infinitesimal rise and dx as an infinitesimal run, the slope is simply the rise over the run, just as it always is, and hence is dy/dx. To apply this approach to a specific curve (say y = x3, the case we considered while cubing numbers slightly greater than 2), we calculate dy as follows.

When Isaac Newton explained the elliptical orbits of the planets and when Katherine Johnson calculated the trajectory of John Glenn’s space capsule, they were both solving a class of differential equations known as ordinary differential equations. The word ordinary is not meant to be pejorative. It’s the term of art for differential equations that depend on just one independent variable.

Partial differential equations are much richer than ordinary differential equations. They describe continuous systems moving and changing in space and time simultaneously or in two or more dimensions of space. Along with a cooling bowl of soup, the saggy shape of a hammock is described by such an equation. So is the spreading of a pollutant in a lake or the flow of air over the wing of a fighter plane.

When we started to work on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos, everything was in such a hurry that it wasn’t really ready. All the secrets of the project—everything about the atomic bomb—were kept in filing cabinets which, if they had locks at all, were locked with padlocks which had maybe only three pins: they were as easy as pie to open.

Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.22 It wasn’t the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.

Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

Nature is very clever; the air trapped by your finger in the straw will increase its volume just enough so that its pressure will decrease just the right amount (about 0.005 atmosphere) so that the pressure in the liquid in the straw at the same level of the surface of the liquid in the glass becomes the same: 1 atmosphere.

In addition to the Bernoulli lift there is a so-called reaction lift. B. C. Johnson describes this in detail in his delightful article “Aerodynamic Lift, Bernoulli Effect, Reaction Lift” (http://mb-soft.com/public2/lift.html). Reaction lift (named for Newton’s third law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) comes about when air passes underneath an airplane wing angled upward.

the “action.” That action must be met by an equal reaction of air pushing upward, so there is upward lift on the wing. In the case of a Boeing 747 (cruising at 550 miles per hour at an altitude of about 30,000 feet) more than 80 percent of the lift comes from reaction lift, and less than 20 percent from Bernoulli lift.

Your hand jiggles around quite a bit. In fact, it’s this difficulty in controlling reaction lift that accounts for why most airplane crashes occur close to takeoff and landing. The fraction of lift accounted for by reaction lift is higher at takeoff and landing than during flight at normal altitude. This is why when a big airliner lands, you can sometimes feel the plane wobble.

For the time being, we are only interested in the light that reflects just once. When the light exits the front of the drop, some of the light again refracts, separating the different colored rays still further.

The angle at which the red light exits can be anything between 0 degrees and 42 degrees but never more than 42 degrees, and this maximum angle is different for each of the

All raindrops at 42 degrees from the “imaginary line” will be red. Those at 40 degrees will be blue. raindrops at angles smaller than 40 degrees will be white (like the sunlight). We will see no light from drops at angles larger than 42 degrees (see text).

What about the blue band in the rainbow? Well, remember its magic number is just about 40 degrees, 2 degrees less than the red band. So blue light can be found refracting, reflecting, and refracting out of different raindrops at a maximum angle of 40 degrees.

The answer is that at the maximum angle for any given color, that color dominates all other colors. With red, though, because its angle is the highest, it is the only color.

when the Sun is low in the sky and when your shadow is long, then a rainbow may be enormous, reaching halfway up into the sky. Why halfway? Because the maximum angle it can be over the horizon is 42 degrees, or close to 45 degrees, which is half of the 90 degrees that would be right overhead.

If the waves are high enough and if they make lots of small water drops, these droplets act like raindrops and you can see two small pieces of the rainbow: one piece at about 42 degrees to the left of the imaginary line and a second piece about 42 degrees to the right.

If you’ve seen a double rainbow, you’ve probably noticed that the secondary bow is much fainter than the primary bow. You probably haven’t noticed, though, that the order of colors in the secondary bow is blue on the outside and red on the inside, the reverse of that in the primary.

In order to understand the origin of the secondary bow, we have to go back to our ideal raindrop—remember, of course, that it actually takes zillions of drops to make up a secondary rainbow as well. Some of the light rays entering the drops reflect just once; others reflect twice before exiting. While light rays entering any given raindrop can reflect many times inside it, the primary bow is only created by those that reflect once.

secondary bow, on the other hand, is created only by those that reflect twice inside before refracting on the way out. This extra bounce inside the raindrop is the reason the colors are reversed in the secondary bow.

You therefore need to look for the secondary bow about 10 degrees outside the primary bow. The reason that the secondary bow is much fainter is that so much less light reflects inside the raindrops twice than reflects once, so there’s less light to make the bow.

This was such a thrilling experience for the students that you might want to try it at home; making a glassbow is not too difficult. It does depend on what your objectives are. If you just want to see the colors of the bow, it’s quite easy. If you want to see the entire bow encircling your head it’s more work.

If you prefer to place the cardboard farther away, say 1.5 meters (5 feet), then you have to move the cardboard about 0.75 meters (2.5 feet) to see the colors of the bow. You may wonder how I arrived at these numbers. The reason is simple, the radius of a glassbow is about 28 degrees.

Then, through an almost absurdly complicated process, the eardrum vibrates the bones of the middle ear, known wonderfully as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, and they in turn produce waves in the fluid in the inner ear.

The Sun, for instance, with a temperature of about 6,000 kelvin at its surface, radiates a little less than half its energy (46 percent) in visible light. Most of the rest is in infrared (49 percent) and ultraviolet (5 percent) radiation. It’s nowhere near hot enough to emit X-rays. The Sun does emit some X-rays, the physics of which is not fully understood, but the energy emitted in X-rays is only about one-millionth of the total energy it emits. Your own body emits infrared radiation (see chapter 9); it’s not hot enough to emit visible light.

They also expected bremsstrahlung from the lunar surface due to the impact of electrons present in the solar wind. Since the Moon is so close, X-rays might be detectable.

-rays from deep space? Why? No one understood the finding. Before that flight we had known of exactly one star that emitted X-rays, our own Sun. And if the Sun had been 10 light-years away, say, which is really just around the corner in astronomical terms, the equipment in that historic flight was a million

times too insensitive to detect its X-rays. Everyone knew this. So wherever this source was located, it had to emit at least a million times more X-rays than the Sun—and that was only if it was really close by. Astronomical objects that produced (at least) a million or a billion times more X-rays than the Sun were literally unheard of. And there was no physics to describe such an object. In other words, it had to be a brand new kind of phenomenon in the heavens. A whole new field of science was born the night of June 18–19, 1962: X-ray astronomy.

But they were basically extending the reach of a centuries-old instrument, in a field dating back millennia. As X-ray astronomers, we were experiencing the dawn of a whole new scientific field. Who knew where it would lead, or what we would discover? We surely didn’t!

Our balloons carried our X-ray detectors to an altitude of about 145,000 feet (about 30 miles), where the atmospheric pressure is only 0.3 percent of that at sea level. When the atmosphere is this thin, a good fraction of X-rays with energies above 15 keV get through.

I remember in the 1960s and 1970s I would read every single paper that came out on X-ray astronomy. In 1974 I gave five lectures in Leiden (Oort was in my audience), and I was able to cover all of X-ray astronomy. Nowadays thousands of papers on X-ray astronomy are published every year, in a multitude of subfields, and no one can grasp the entire field.

The early years were the most fantastic years for me. They were also demanding, in just about every way: intellectually, physically, even logistically. Launching balloons was so complicated and expensive, time-consuming, and tension producing, I can hardly describe it. I’ll try, though.

you have to get the money to build equipment and pay students and sometimes to travel very far. Lots of what scientists really do is write grant proposals, in highly competitive programs, to get supported to do research.

The higher the energy of the X-rays, the stronger the light flashes. We used photomultipliers to detect the light flashes and convert them into electric pulses: the brighter the light flash, the higher the voltage of a pulse.

We knew that Sco X-1 emitted 99.9 percent of its energy in the form of X-rays, and that its X-ray luminosity was about 10,000 times the total luminosity of our Sun and about 10 billion times the X-ray luminosity of the Sun. For Sco X-1 to change its luminosity by a factor of four on a time scale of ten minutes—well, there was simply no physics to understand it.

possible to wrap a sheet of paper so that it fits snugly against a sphere, without folding it, stretching it, or tearing it. Geometry on a sphere is intrinsically different from geometry on a plane. For example, the Earth’s equator and the lines of longitude for 0° and 90° to its north determine a triangle that has three right angles and three equal sides (assuming the Earth to be a sphere). So Pythagoras’s equation is false.

A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements. It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations. For example, Aristotle’s theory that everything was made out of four elements, earth, air, fire, and water, was simple enough to qualify, but it did not make any definite predictions.

people feel that science should be concerned with only the first part; they regard the question of the initial situation as a matter for metaphysics or religion. They would say that God, being omnipotent, could have started the universe off any way he wanted. That may be so, but in that case he also could have made it develop in a completely arbitrary way. Yet it appears that he chose to make it evolve in a very regular way according to certain laws. It therefore seems equally reasonable to suppose that there are also laws governing the initial state.

Gravity is the weakest of the four forces by a long way; it is so weak that we would not notice it at all were it not for two special properties that it has: it can act over large distances, and it is always attractive.

addition to the photon, there were three other spin-1 particles, known collectively as massive vector bosons, that carried the weak force. These were called W+ (pronounced W plus), W− (pronounced W minus), and Z° (pronounced Z naught), and each had a mass of around 100 GeV

The strong nuclear force has a curious property called confinement: it always binds particles together into combinations that have no color. One cannot have a single quark on its own because it would have a color (red, green, or blue). Instead, a red quark has to be joined to a green and a blue quark by a ‘string’ of gluons

The success of the unification of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces led to a number of attempts to combine these two forces with the strong nuclear force into what is called a grand unified theory (or GUT).

The basic idea of GUTs is as follows: as was mentioned above, the strong nuclear force gets weaker at high energies. On the other hand, the electromagnetic and weak forces, which are not asymptotically free, get stronger at high energies. At some very high energy, called the grand unification energy, these three forces would all have the same strength and so could just be different aspects of a single force.

The EM spectrum refers to all the possible wavelengths of radiation existing in nature. Different-sized waves have different properties and are generated by different physical processes. Furthermore, they must be detected by completely different equipment. The invisible radiation coming from stars and galaxies (in addition to the visible or optical band) gives useful information, though it can’t be seen with the unaided eye.

The “stop, drop, and breathe” process assumes that you can calm yourself quickly enough to try a do-over of whatever pushed your buttons. But when your body goes into fight-or-flight, you’re pumped full of neurochemicals telling you to attack. Your child looks like the enemy, and you feel an urgent need to “set him straight.” But it doesn’t take the body an hour to calm down, unless you encountered a tiger. Seriously. Whatever your child did, it really was not an emergency. If it’s taking more than a few minutes to calm down, it’s because you haven’t told your body it was a false alarm. Your body is still in fight-or-flight. And your mind is still on the warpath, so it takes an hour to “distract” it.

Then, hand your kid the mom and play out the scenario again, with you being the kid. Make it funny so you can both giggle and let off tension. Make sure to include scenarios in which the kid goes to school in his PJs, or the mom goes to work in her PJs, or the kid has to yell at the mom to hurry up and get ready, or the mom says

Don’t start talking until you have your child’s attention. Get down on your child’s level and touch him lightly. Look him in the eye. Wait until he looks up. Then start talking. If you can’t do this for some reason—for example, if you’re in the car—make sure you have his attention by asking, “Can I tell you something?”

You can help your child with her anger by remembering that an angry child is showing you that she’s scared, disconnected, and hurting inside. Your job is to acknowledge both the anger and the emotions underneath it. Once children have a chance to feel the vulnerable feelings they’ve been avoiding, they no longer need the anger as a defense, and it melts away.

Then, about 1907, one of the more imaginative, perhaps even iconoclastic, of the classical physicists moved to centre stage. Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), a former student of Thomson’s at Cambridge, was by this time professor of physics at the University of Manchester and working in the new research area of radioactivity.

Have you ever had to tell apart a raw egg and a boiled egg, without taking their shells off? There’s an easy way to do it. Put the egg down on a smooth, hard surface and set it spinning. After a few seconds, briefly touch the outside of the shell with one finger, just enough to stop the egg’s rotation. The egg might just sit there, stationary. But after a second or two, it might slowly start to spin again. Raw and boiled eggs look the same on the outside, but their insides are different and that gives the secret away. When you touched the cooked egg, you stopped a whole solid object. But when you stopped the raw egg, you only stopped the shell.

The most precious treasure the whale carries down into the gloom is oxygen, needed to sustain the chemical reactions that power the swimming muscles, and the whale’s very life. But the gaseous oxygen supplied by the atmosphere becomes a liability in the deep – in fact, as soon as the whale leaves the surface, the air in its lungs becomes a problem. For every additional metre it swims downwards, the weight of one extra metre of water presses inwards. Nitrogen and oxygen molecules are bouncing off each other and the lung walls, and each collision provides a minuscule push. At the surface, the inward and outward pushes on the whale balance. But as the giant sinks, it is squashed by the additional weight of the water above it, and the push of the outside overwhelms the push from the inside. So the walls of the lungs move inwards until equilibrium, the point where the pushes are balanced once again.

On Earth, there is a limit to what gravity can do to you. That’s because you are only accelerated by the overall force on you, called the resultant force. As you speed up, you have to push more air out of the way in a given period of time, and that air also pushes back on you, effectively reducing the pull of gravity because it’s pushing in the opposite direction. At some point, those two things balance, and you will travel at your terminal velocity, unable to get any faster.

Buoyancy can be a very useful and quick indicator of what’s inside a sealed object. For example, if you take identically sized cans of a fizzy drink, one diet version and one with a full load of sugar, you’ll see that the diet can floats in fresh water and the other one sinks. The cans have exactly the same volume, so the difference is all inside, and it’s all that dense sugar. A standard 330 ml can of pop has 35–50 g of sugar inside it, and that extra mass counts, making the can overall more dense than water.

If your parents used spanking as a discipline method growing up, you may have reconciled yourself to their behavior by justifying it. You may even think there is no other choice for managing children who are “a handful.” I often hear “I got hit when I was a kid and I turned out okay,” or “I was spanked as a child, and I deserved it.” It’s very hard for us to believe that people who loved us would intentionally hurt us

Setting limits is an essential part of parenting. Limits keep our children safe and healthy and support them in learning social norms so that they can function happily in society. And if we set limits empathically, kids are more likely to internalize the ability to set limits for themselves, which is otherwise known as self-discipline.

The most common reason that children test the limits is that they really want to find out where those limits are. Children need the security of knowing that someone more experienced and knowledgeable is looking out for them.

So back in 2007, I started to read self-help books and discovered affirmations. You create a statement that encapsulates what you want to be and then repeat it to yourself. It’s a way to change a mindset that then allows you to take steps towards achieving a specific goal. My affirmation was “I am creative, I am an author.” I felt neither of those things and I couldn’t say it out loud for a while, but I kept repeating it and eventually started saying it out loud. Telling myself “I am creative” somehow released a block in me and enabled me to start creating and exploring.

Never interrupt a happily engaged baby. Okay, there may be times when you must. But in general, when a baby or child is focused on something, he’s working. Interrupting him is disrespectful, implying that what he was doing isn’t important. It keeps him from solving that particular problem, at least for now, but more importantly it interferes with his concentration and “attention span” muscle building. This is how he learns to play by himself, which you’ll be very happy about when he’s three.

Since the investor had no funds to repay the loan, both the broker and the investor had no profit to show for it.

To most serious meteorologists, forecasting was less than science. It was a seat-of–the-pants business performed by technicians who needed some intuitive ability to read the next day’s weather in the instruments and the clouds. It was guesswork. At centers like M.I.T., meteorology favored problems that had solutions. Lorenz understood the messiness of weather prediction as well as anyone, having tried it firsthand for the benefit of military pilots, but he harbored an interest in the problem—a mathematical interest.

Lorenz never was the type to shout Eureka. Serendipity merely led him to a place he had been all along. He was ready to explore the consequences of his discovery by working out what it must mean for the way science understood flows in all kinds of fluids. Had he stopped with the Butterfly Effect, an image of predictability giving way to pure randomness, then Lorenz would have produced no more than a piece of very bad news. But Lorenz saw more than randomness embedded in his weather model. He saw a fine geometrical structure, order masquerading as randomness. He was a mathematician in meteorologist’s clothing, after all, and now he began to lead a double life. He would write papers that were pure meteorology. But he would also write papers that were pure mathematics, with a slightly misleading dose of weather talk as preface. Eventually the prefaces would disappear altogether

Nature is full of others: animal populations that rise and fall almost regularly, epidemics that come and go on tantalizingly near-regular schedules.

His colleagues were astonished that Lorenz had mimicked both aperiodicity and sensitive dependence on initial conditions in his toy version of the weather: twelve equations, calculated over and over again with ruthless mechanical efficiency. How could such richness, such unpredictability—such chaos—arise from a simple deterministic system? L ORENZ PUT THE WEATHER ASIDE and looked for even simpler ways to produce this complex behavior. He found one in a system of just three equations. They were nonlinear, meaning that they expressed relationships that were not strictly proportional. Linear relationships can be captured with a straight line on a graph. Linear relationships are easy to think about: the more the merrier

The story of the computer over the past fifty-plus years has been painted as one of exponential growth year after year—referencing, in part, the famously accurate “Moore’s Law” prediction, made by Intel’s Gordon Moore in 1975, that the number of transistors in CPUs would double every two years. What hasn’t improved at that rate is the performance of memory, which means that relative to processing time, the cost of accessing memory is also increasing exponentially.

Bélády compared Random Eviction, FIFO, and variants of LRU in a number of scenarios and found that LRU consistently performed the closest to clairvoyance. The LRU principle is effective because of something computer scientists call “temporal locality”: if a program has called for a particular piece of information once, it’s likely to do so again in the near future.

Humans clearly have context-switching costs too. We feel them when we move papers on and off our desk, close and open documents on our computer, walk into a room without remembering what had sent us there, or simply say out loud, “Now, where was I?” or “What was I saying?” Psychologists have shown that for us, the effects of switching tasks can include both delays and errors—at the scale of minutes rather than microseconds. To put that figure in perspective, anyone you interrupt more than a few times an hour is in danger of doing no work at all.

To make things concrete, let’s say a friend shows you two different coins. One is a normal, “fair” coin with a 50–50 chance of heads and tails; the other is a two-headed coin. He drops them into a bag and then pulls one out at random. He flips it once: heads. Which coin do you think your friend flipped?

Once you know about overfitting, you see it everywhere. Overfitting, for instance, explains the irony of our palates. How can it be that the foods that taste best to us are broadly considered to be bad for our health, when the entire function of taste buds, evolutionarily speaking, is to prevent us from eating things that are bad? The answer is that taste is our body’s proxy metric for health. Fat, sugar, and salt are important nutrients, and for a couple hundred thousand years, being drawn to foods containing them was a reasonable measure for a sustaining diet. But being able to modify the foods available to us broke that relationship. We can now add fat and sugar to foods beyond amounts that

In machine learning, the advantages of moving slowly emerge most concretely in a regularization technique known as Early Stopping. When we looked at the German marriage survey data at the beginning of the chapter, we went straight to examining the best-fitted one-, two-, and ninefactor models. In many situations, however, tuning the parameters to find the best possible fit for given data is a process in and of itself. What happens if we stop that process early and simply don’t allow a model the time to become too complex? Again, what might seem at first blush like being halfhearted or unthorough emerges, instead, as an important strategy in its own right.

considering questions of profession or career, we ask questions like What would you do if you won the lottery? or, taking a different tack, What would you do if all jobs paid the same? The idea behind such thought exercises is exactly that of Constraint Relaxation: to make the intractable tractable, to make progress in an idealized world that can be ported back to the real one. If you can’t solve the problem in front of you, solve an easier version of it—and then see if that solution offers you a starting point, or a beacon, in the full-blown problem. Maybe it does.

Once the engines cut and you’re in orbit, the shuttle’s no longer accelerating. Your perception is that you’ve come to a complete stop. You’re moving at 17,500 miles per hour, but your inner ear is telling your brain that you’re perfectly still; your vestibular system works on gravity, and without any gravity signals coming in, the system thinks you’re not moving. So you have this sensation like you’re lurching forward but then you come to a stop when the engines cut. You feel like you’re sitting straight up in a dining room chair, except that you’re still strapped down flat on your back.

he talked about his days as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California, flying the X-15, the hypersonic rocket plane that set speed and altitude records in the 1960s by flying 50 miles above the Earth, the outer limit of the atmosphere, the edge of space. That was how Neil Armstrong thought of himself: as a pilot. Not as the first man to walk on the moon, but as a guy who loved to fly cool planes and was grateful for the opportunity to have done it.

I was glued to the television. Watching Neil Armstrong take those first lunar steps completely blew my mind. But seeing it on TV almost made it seem normal, like it could have been any old TV show. Going outside afterward made me think about how incredible it was. I remember standing in my front yard and staring up at the moon for the longest time, thinking, Wow, there are people up there, walking around. To a six-year-old kid in the suburbs on Long Island, it was the most awe-inspiring thing in the world. Something about it grabbed me down deep in my soul.

One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate

Much of this evolution is driven by economics and national policy, rather than by performance considerations. In order to understand today’s Internet network structure, let’s incrementally build a series of network structures, with each new structure being a better approximation of the complex Internet that we have today.

Now if some company builds and operates a global transit ISP that is profitable, then it is natural for other companies to build their own global transit ISPs and compete with the original global transit ISP. This leads to Network Structure 2, which consists of the hundreds of thousands of access ISPs and multiple global transit ISPs. The access ISPs certainly prefer Network Structure 2 over Network Structure 1 since they can now choose among the competing global transit providers as a function of their pricing and services.

Each regional ISP then connects to tier-1 ISPs. Tier-1 ISPs are similar to our (imaginary) global transit ISP; but tier-1 ISPs, which actually do exist, do not have a presence in every city in the world. There are approximately a dozen tier-1 ISPs, including Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT.

To build a network that more closely resembles today’s Internet, we must add points of presence (PoPs), multi-homing, peering, and Internet exchange points (IXPs) to the hierarchical Network Structure 3. PoPs exist in all levels of the hierarchy, except for the bottom (access ISP) level. A PoP is simply a group of one or more routers (at the same location) in the provider’s network where customer ISPs can connect into the provider ISP.

To reduce these costs, a pair of nearby ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy can peer, that is, they can directly connect their networks together so that all the traffic between them passes over the direct connection rather than through upstream intermediaries. When two ISPs peer, it is typically settlement-free, that is, neither ISP pays the other.

The most important of these delays are the nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propagation delay; together, these delays accumulate to give a total nodal delay. The performance of many Internet applications—such as search, Web browsing, e-mail, maps, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP—are greatly affected by network delays. In order to acquire a deep understanding of packet switching and computer networks, we must understand the nature and importance of these delays.

Assuming that packets are transmitted in a first-come-first-served manner, as is common in packetswitched networks, our packet can be transmitted only after all the packets that have arrived before it have been transmitted. Denote the length of the packet by L bits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to router B by R bits/sec. For example, for a 10 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R=10 Mbps; for a 100 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R=100 Mbps. The transmission delay is L/R. This is the amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into the link

difference between transmission delay and propagation delay. The difference is subtle but important. The transmission delay is the amount of time required for the router to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet’s length and the transmission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the distance between the two routers. The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit to propagate from one router to the next; it is a function of the distance between the two routers, but has nothing to do with the packet’s length or the transmission rate of the link

In VoIP, the sending side must first fill a packet with encoded digitized speech before passing the packet to the Internet. This time to fill a packet—called the packetization delay—can be significant and can impact the user-perceived quality of a VoIP call. This issue will be further explored in a homework problem at the end of this chapter.

A process is analogous to a house and its socket is analogous to its door. When a process wants to send a message to another process on another host, it shoves the message out its door (socket). This sending process assumes that there is a transportation infrastructure on the other side of its door that will transport the message to the door of the destination process. Once the message arrives at the destination host, the message passes through the receiving process’s door (socket), and the receiving process then acts on the message

It is important to note that the server sends requested files to clients without storing any state information about the client. If a particular client asks for the same object twice in a period of a few seconds, the server does not respond by saying that it just served the object to the client; instead, the server resends the object, as it has completely forgotten what it did earlier. Because an HTTP server maintains no information about the clients, HTTP is said to be a stateless protocol

Non-persistent connections have some shortcomings. First, a brand-new connection must be established and maintained for each requested object. For each of these connections, TCP buffers must be allocated and TCP variables must be kept in both the client and server. This can place a significant burden on the Web server, which may be serving requests from hundreds of different clients simultaneously. Second, as we just described, each object suffers a delivery delay of two RTTs—one RTT to establish the TCP connection and one RTT to request and receive an object. With HTTP 1.1 persistent connections, the server leaves the TCP connection open after sending a response. Subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server can be sent over the same connection. In particular, an entire Web page (in the example above, the base HTML file and the 10 images) can be sent over a single persistent TCP connection.

Now let’s look at the header lines in the example. The header line Host: www.someschool.edu specifies the host on which the object resides. You might think that this header line is unnecessary, as there is already a TCP connection in place to the host. But, as we’ll see in Section 2.2.5, the information provided by the host header line is required by Web proxy caches. By including the Connection: close header line, the browser is telling the server that it doesn’t want to bother with persistent connections; it wants the server to close the connection after sending the requested object.

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol. For example, hardware-implemented protocols in two physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the “wire” between the two network interface cards; congestion-control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver; protocols in routers determine a packet’s path from source to destination. Protocols are running everywhere in the Internet, and consequently much of this book is about computer network protocols.

Cable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems. As with a DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the home PC through an Ethernet port. (We will discuss Ethernet in great detail in Chapter 6.) At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM—turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format.

The DOCSIS 2.0 standard defines downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and upstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps. As in the case of DSL networks, the maximum achievable rate may not be realized due to lower contracted data rates or media impairments.

The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber, with one fiber leaving the CO for each home. More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers.

Store-and-Forward Transmission Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the links. Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. To explore store-and-forward transmission in more detail, consider a simple network consisting of two end systems connected by a single router, as shown in Figure 1.11. A router will typically have many incident links, since its job is to switch an incoming packet onto an outgoing link; in this simple example, the router has the rather simple task of transferring a packet from one (input) link to the only other attached link. In this example, the source has three packets, each consisting of L bits, to send to the destination. At the snapshot of time shown in Figure 1.11, the source has transmitted some of packet 1, and the front of packet 1 has already arrived at the router. Because the router employs store-and-forwarding, at this instant of time, the router cannot transmit the bits it has received; instead it must first buffer (i.e., “store”) the packet’s bits. Only after the router has received all of the packet’s bits can it begin to transmit (i.e., “forward”) the packet onto the outbound link.

The source begins to transmit at time 0; at time L/R seconds, the source has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire packet has been received and stored at the router (since there is no propagation delay). At time L/R seconds, since the router has just received the entire packet, it can begin to transmit the packet onto the outbound link towards the destination; at time 2L/R, the router has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire packet has been received by the destination. Thus, the total delay is 2L/R. If the Figure 1.11 Store-and-forward packet switching switch instead forwarded bits as soon as they arrive (without first receiving the entire packet), then the total delay would be L/R since bits are not held up at the router. But, as we will discuss in Section 1.4, routers need to receive, store, and process the entire packet before forwarding.

Thus, at time 2L/R, the destination has received the first packet and the router has received the second packet.

Let’s now consider the general case of sending one packet from source to destination over a path consisting of N links each of rate R (thus, there are N-1 routers between source and destination). Applying the same logic as above, we see that the end-to-end delay is: dend-to-end=NLR (1.1)

Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an Figure 1.12 Packet switching arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for transmission. In this case, packet loss will occur—either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped.

each router has a forwarding table that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router’s outbound links. When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link. The router then directs the packet to this outbound link. The end-to-end routing process is analogous to a car driver who does not use maps but instead prefers to ask for directions.

circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems. In packet-switched networks, these resources are not reserved; a session’s messages use the resources on demand and, as a consequence, may have to wait (that is, queue) for access to a communication link.

Note that the access ISP does not have to be a telco or a cable company; instead it can be, for example, a university (providing Internet access to students, staff, and faculty), or a company (providing access for its employees). But connecting end users and content providers into an access ISP is only a small piece of solving the puzzle of connecting the billions of end systems that make up the Internet. To complete this puzzle, the access ISPs themselves must be interconnected. This is done by creating a network of networks—understanding this phrase is the key to understanding the Internet. Over the years, the network of networks that forms the Internet has evolved into a very complex structure. Much of this evolution is driven by economics and national policy, rather than by performance considerations. In order to understand today’s Internet network structure, let’s incrementally build a series of network structures, with each new structure being a better approximation of the complex Internet that we have today.

One naive approach would be to have each access ISP directly connect with every other access ISP. Such a mesh design is, of course, much too costly for the access ISPs, as it would require each access ISP to have a separate communication link to each of the hundreds of thousands of other access ISPs all over the world.

Network Structure 2, just described, is a two-tier hierarchy with global transit providers residing at the top tier and access ISPs at the bottom tier. This assumes that global transit ISPs are not only capable of getting close to each and every access ISP, but also find it economically desirable to do so.

no ISP has presence in each and every city in the world. Instead, in any given region, there may be a regional ISP to which the access ISPs in the region connect. Each regional ISP then connects to tier-1 ISPs. Tier-1 ISPs are similar to our (imaginary) global transit ISP; but tier-1 ISPs, which actually do exist, do not have a presence in every city in the world. There are approximately a dozen tier-1 ISPs, including Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT.

Any ISP (except for tier-1 ISPs) may choose to multi-home, that is, to connect to two or more provider ISPs. So, for example, an access ISP may multi-home with two regional ISPs, or it may multi-home with two regional ISPs and also with a tier-1 ISP. Similarly, a regional ISP may multi-home with multiple tier-1 ISPs. When an ISP multi-homes, it can continue to send and receive packets into the Internet even if one of its providers has a failure.

We now finally arrive at Network Structure 5, which describes today’s Internet. Network Structure 5, illustrated in Figure 1.15, builds on top of Network Structure 4 by adding content-provider networks. Google is currently one of the leading examples of such a content-provider network. As of this writing, it is estimated that Google has 50–100 data centers distributed across North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia. Some of these data centers house over one hundred thousand servers, while other data centers are smaller, housing only hundreds of servers. The Google data centers are all interconnected via Google’s private TCP/IP network, which spans the entire globe but is nevertheless separate from the public Internet

Transmission Delay Assuming that packets are transmitted in a first-come-first-served manner, as is common in packetswitched networks, our packet can be transmitted only after all the packets that have arrived before it have been transmitted. Denote the length of the packet by L bits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to router B by R bits/sec. For example, for a 10 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R=10 Mbps; for a 100 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R=100 Mbps. The transmission delay is L/R. This is the amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into the link

Comparing Transmission and Propagation Delay Exploring propagation delay and transmission delay Newcomers to the field of computer networking sometimes have difficulty understanding the difference between transmission delay and propagation delay. The difference is subtle but important. The transmission delay is the amount of time required for the router to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet’s length and the transmission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the distance between the two routers. The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit to propagate from one router to the next; it is a function of the distance between the two routers, but has nothing to do with the packet’s length or the transmission rate of the link

An analogy might clarify the notions of transmission and propagation delay. Consider a highway that has a tollbooth every 100 kilometers, as shown in Figure 1.17. You can think of the highway segments between tollbooths as links and the tollbooths as routers. Suppose that cars travel (that is, propagate) on the highway at a rate of 100 km/hour (that is, when a car leaves a tollbooth, it instantaneously accelerates to 100 km/hour and maintains that speed between tollbooths). Suppose next that 10 cars, traveling together as a caravan, follow each other in a fixed order. You can think of each car as a bit and the caravan as a packet. Also suppose that each Figure 1.17 Caravan analogy tollbooth services (that is, transmits) a car at a rate of one car per 12 seconds, and that it is late at night so that the caravan’s cars are the only cars on the highway. Finally, suppose that whenever the first car of the caravan arrives at a tollbooth, it waits at the entrance until the other nine cars have arrived and lined up behind it. (Thus the entire caravan must be stored at the tollbooth before it can begin to be forwarded.) The time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the highway is (10 cars)/(5 cars/minute)=2 minutes. This time is analogous to the transmission delay in a router. The time required for a car to travel from the exit of one tollbooth to the next tollbooth is 100 km/(100 km/hour)=1 hour. This time is analogous to propagation delay.

Recall that R is the transmission rate; that is, it is the rate (in bits/sec) at which bits are pushed out of the queue. Also suppose, for simplicity, that all packets consist of L bits. Then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue is La bits/sec. Finally, assume that the queue is very big, so that it can hold essentially an infinite number of bits. The ratio La/R, called the traffic intensity, often plays an important role in estimating the extent of the queuing delay. If La/R > 1, then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue exceeds the rate at which the bits can be transmitted from the queue. In this unfortunate situation, the queue will tend to increase without bound

Packet Loss In our discussions above, we have assumed that the queue is capable of holding an infinite number of packets. In reality a queue preceding a link has finite capacity, although the queuing capacity greatly depends on the router design and cost. Because the queue capacity is finite, packet delays do not really approach infinity as the traffic intensity approaches 1. Instead, a packet can arrive to find a full queue. With no place to store such a packet, a router will drop that packet; that is, the packet will be lost. This overflow at a queue can again be seen in the Java applet for a queue when the traffic intensity is greater than 1. From an end-system viewpoint, a packet loss will look like a packet having been transmitted into the network core but never emerging from the network at the destination. The fraction of lost packets increases as the traffic intensity increases. Therefore, performance at a node is often measured not only in terms of delay, but also in terms of the probability of packet loss.

More specifically, suppose there are N−1 routers between the source and the destination. Then the source will send N special packets into the network, with each packet addressed to the ultimate destination. These N special packets are marked 1 through N, with the first packet marked 1 and the last packet marked N. When the nth router receives the nth packet marked n, the router does not forward the packet toward its destination, but instead sends a message back to the source. When the destination host receives the Nth packet, it too returns a message back to the source. The source records the time that elapses between when it sends a packet and when it receives the corresponding return message; it also records the name and address of the router (or the destination host) that returns the message. In this manner, the source can reconstruct the route taken by packets flowing from source to destination, and the source can determine the round-trip delays to all the intervening routers. Traceroute actually repeats the experiment just described three times, so the source actually sends 3 • N packets to the destination. RFC 1393 describes Traceroute in detail. Here is an example of the output of the Traceroute program, where the route was being traced from the source host gaia.cs.umass.edu (at the University of Massachusetts) to the host cis.poly.edu (at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn). The output has six columns: the first column is the n value described above, that is, the number of the router along the route; the second column is the name of the router; the third column is the address of the router (of the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx); the last three columns are the round-trip delays for three experiments. If the source receives fewer than three messages from any given router (due to packet loss in the network), Traceroute places an asterisk just after the router number and reports fewer than three round-trip times for that router. 1 cs-gw (128.119.240.254) 1.009 ms 0.899 ms 0.993 ms 2 128.119.3.154 (128.119.3.154) 0.931 ms 0.441 ms 0.651 ms 3 -border4-rt-gi-1-3.gw.umass.edu (128.119.2.194) 1.032 ms 0.484 ms 0.451 ms 4 -acr1-ge-2-1-0.Boston.cw.net (208.172.51.129) 10.006 ms 8.150 ms 8.460 ms 5 -agr4-loopback.NewYork.cw.net (206.24.194.104) 12.272 ms 14.344 ms 13.267 ms 6 -acr2-loopback.NewYork.cw.net (206.24.194.62) 13.225 ms 12.292 ms 12.148 ms 7 -pos10-2.core2.NewYork1.Level3.net (209.244.160.133) 12.218 ms 11.823 ms 11.793 ms 8 -gige9-1-52.hsipaccess1.NewYork1.Level3.net (64.159.17.39) 13.081 ms 11.556 ms 13.297 ms 9 -p0-0.polyu.bbnplanet.net (4.25.109.122) 12.716 ms 13.052 ms 12.786 ms 10 cis.poly.edu (128.238.32.126) 14.080 ms 13.035 ms 12.802 ms In the trace above there are nine routers between the source and the destination.

In VoIP, the sending side must first fill a packet with encoded digitized speech before passing the packet to the Internet. This time to fill a packet—called the packetization delay—can be significant and can impact the user-perceived quality of a VoIP call. This issue will be further explored in a homework problem at the end of this chapter.

1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks In addition to delay and packet loss, another critical performance measure in computer networks is endto-end throughput. To define throughput, consider transferring a large file from Host A to Host B across a computer network. This transfer might be, for example, a large video clip from one peer to another in a P2P file sharing system. The instantaneous throughput at any instant of time is the rate (in bits/sec) at which Host B is receiving the file.

the file consists of F bits and the transfer takes T seconds for Host B to receive all F bits, then the average throughput of the file transfer is F/T bits/sec. For some applications, such as Internet telephony, it is desirable to have a low delay and an instantaneous throughput consistently above some threshold (for example, over 24 kbps for some Internet telephony applications and over 256 kbps for some real-time video applications). For other applications, including those involving file transfers, delay is not critical, but it is desirable to have the highest possible throughput. To gain further insight into the important concept of throughput, let’s consider a few examples. Figure 1.19(a) shows two end systems, a server and a client, connected by two communication links and a router. Consider the throughput for a file transfer from the server to the client. Let R denote the rate of the link between the server and the router; and R denote the rate of the link between the router and the client.

Now suppose that all the links in the core of the communication network have very high transmission rates, much higher than R and R . Indeed, today, the core of the Internet is over-provisioned with high speed links that experience little congestion. Also suppose that the only bits being sent in the entire network are those from the server to the client. Because the core of the computer network is like a wide pipe in this example, the rate at which bits can flow from source to destination is again the minimum of R and R , that is, throughput = min{R , R }. Therefore, the constraining factor for throughput in today’s Internet is typically the access network.

Therefore, the constraining factor for throughput in today’s Internet is typically the access network. For a final example, consider Figure 1.20(b) in which there are 10 servers and 10 clients connected to the core of the computer network. In this example, there are 10 simultaneous downloads taking place, involving 10 client-server pairs. Suppose that these 10 downloads are the only traffic in the network at the current time. As shown in the figure, there is a link in the core that is traversed by all 10 downloads. Denote R for the transmission rate of this link R. Let’s suppose that all server access links have the same rate R , all client access links have the same rate R , and the transmission rates of all the links in the core—except the one common link of rate R—are much larger than R , R , and R. Now we ask, what are the throughputs of the downloads? Clearly, if the rate of the common link, R, is large—say a hundred times larger than both R and R —then the throughput for each download will once again be min{R , R }. But what if the rate of the common link is of the same order as R and R ? What will the throughput be in this case? Let’s take a look at a specific example. Suppose Rs=2 Mbps, Rc=1 Mbps, R=5 Mbps, and the Figure 1.20 End-to-end throughput: (a) Client downloads a file from server; (b) 10 clients downloading with 10 servers

A layered architecture allows us to discuss a well-defined, specific part of a large and complex system. This simplification itself is of considerable value by providing modularity, making it much easier to change the implementation of the service provided by the layer. As long as the layer provides the same service to the layer above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it, the remainder of the system remains unchanged when a layer’s implementation is changed.

As long as the layer provides the same service to the layer above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it, the remainder of the system remains unchanged when a layer’s implementation is changed. (Note that changing the implementation of a service is very different from changing the service itself!) For example, if the gate functions were changed (for instance, to have people board and disembark by height), the remainder of the airline system would remain unchanged since the gate layer still provides the same function (loading and unloading people); it simply implements that function in a different manner after the change.

Protocol layering has conceptual and structural advantages [RFC 3439]. As we have seen, layering provides a structured way to discuss system components. Modularity makes it easier to update system components. We mention, however, that some researchers and networking engineers are vehemently opposed to layering [Wakeman 1992]. One potential drawback of layering is that one layer may duplicate lower-layer functionality. For example, many protocol stacks provide error recovery

Application Layer The application layer is where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside. The Internet’s application layer includes many protocols, such as the HTTP protocol (which provides for Web document request and transfer), SMTP (which provides for the transfer of e-mail messages), and FTP (which provides for the transfer of files between two end systems). We’ll see that certain network functions, such as the translation of human-friendly names for Internet end systems like www.ietf.org to a 32-bit network address, are also done with the help of a specific application-layer protocol, namely, the domain name system (DNS)

Transport Layer The Internet’s transport layer transports application-layer messages between application endpoints. In the Internet there are two transport protocols, TCP and UDP, either of which can transport applicationlayer messages. TCP provides a connection-oriented service to its applications. This service includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control (that is, sender/receiver speed matching). TCP also breaks long messages into shorter segments and provides a congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles its transmission rate when the network is congested.

Network Layer The Internet’s network layer is responsible for moving network-layer packets known as datagrams from one host to another. The Internet transport-layer protocol (TCP or UDP) in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address to the network layer, just as you would give the postal service a letter with a destination address. The network layer then provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer in the destination host.

Link Layer The Internet’s network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination. To move a packet from one node (host or router) to the next node in the route, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer. In particular, at each node, the network layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route. At this next node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the network layer. The services provided by the link layer depend on the specific link-layer protocol that is employed over the link. For example, some link-layer protocols provide reliable delivery, from transmitting node, over one link, to receiving node.

Examples of link-layer protocols include Ethernet, WiFi, and the cable access network’s DOCSIS protocol. As datagrams typically need to traverse several links to travel from source to destination, a datagram may be handled by different link-layer protocols at different links along its route. For example, a datagram may be handled by Ethernet on one link and by PPP on the next link. The network layer will receive a different service from each of the different link-layer protocols. In this book, we’ll refer to the link-layer packets as frames.

Physical Layer While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one network element to an adjacent network element, the job of the physical layer is to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next. The protocols in this layer are again link dependent and further depend on the actual transmission medium of the link (for example, twisted-pair copper wire, single-mode fiber optics). For example, Ethernet has many physical-layer protocols: one for twisted-pair copper wire, another for coaxial cable, another for fiber, and so on. In each case, a bit is moved across the link in a different way.

1.5.2 Encapsulation Figure 1.24 shows the physical path that data takes down a sending end system’s protocol stack, up and down the protocol stacks of an intervening link-layer switch Figure 1.24 Hosts, routers, and link-layer switches; each contains a different set of layers, reflecting their differences in functionality and router, and then up the protocol stack at the receiving end system. As we discuss later in this book, routers and link-layer switches are both packet switches. Similar to end systems, routers and link-layer switches organize their networking hardware and software into layers. But routers and link-layer switches do not implement all of the layers in the protocol stack; they typically implement only the bottom layers. As shown in Figure 1.24, link-layer switches implement layers 1 and 2; routers implement layers 1 through 3. This means, for example, that Internet routers are capable of implementing the IP protocol (a layer 3 protocol), while link-layer switches are not.

We’ll see later that while link-layer switches do not recognize IP addresses, they are capable of recognizing layer 2 addresses, such as Ethernet addresses. Note that hosts implement all five layers; this is consistent with the view that the Internet architecture puts much of its complexity at the edges of the network. Figure 1.24 also illustrates the important concept of encapsulation. At the sending host, an application-layer message (M in Figure 1.24) is passed to the transport layer. In the simplest case, the transport layer takes the message and appends additional information (so-called transport-layer header information, H in Figure 1.24) that will be used by the receiver-side transport layer. The application-layer message and the transport-layer header information together constitute the transportlayer segment. The transport-layer segment thus encapsulates the application-layer message. The added information might include information allowing the receiver-side transport layer to deliver the message up to the appropriate application, and error-detection bits that allow the receiver to determine whether bits in the message have been changed in route. The transport layer then passes the segment to the network layer, which adds network-layer header information

The datagram is then passed to the link layer, which (of course!) will add its own link-layer header information and create a link-layer frame. Thus, we see that at each layer, a packet has two types of fields: header fields and a payload field. The payload is typically a packet from the layer above.

Essentially, this stems from their unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group. Team members who are not genuinely open with one another about their mistakes and weaknesses make it impossible to build a foundation for trust.

From the application developer’s perspective, the network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of services to applications. The application architecture, on the other hand, is designed by the application developer and dictates how the application is structured over the various end systems. In choosing the application architecture, an application developer will likely draw on one of the two predominant architectural paradigms used in modern network applications: the client-server architecture or the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture. In a client-server architecture, there is an always-on host, called the server, which services requests from many other hosts, called clients.

Note that with the client-server architecture, clients do not directly communicate with each other; for example, in the Web application, two browsers do not directly communicate. Another characteristic of the client-server architecture is that the server has a fixed, well-known address, called an IP address (which we’ll discuss soon). Because the server has a fixed, well-known address, and because the server is always on, a client can always contact the server by sending a packet to the server’s IP address.

Often in a client-server application, a single-server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from clients. For example, a popular social-networking site can quickly become overwhelmed if it has only one server handling all of its requests. For this reason, a data center, housing a large number of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server.

Many of today’s most popular and traffic-intensive applications are based on P2P architectures. These applications include file sharing (e.g., BitTorrent), peer-assisted download acceleration (e.g., Xunlei), and Internet telephony and video conference (e.g., Skype). The P2P architecture is illustrated in Figure 2.2(b). We mention that some applications have hybrid architectures, combining both client-server and P2P elements. For example, for many instant messaging applications, servers are used to track the IP addresses of users, but user-touser messages are sent directly between user hosts (without passing through intermediate servers). One of the most compelling features of P2P architectures is their self-scalability. For example, in a P2P file-sharing application, although each peer generates workload by requesting files, each peer also adds service capacity to the system by distributing files to other peers. P2P architectures are also cost effective, since they normally don’t require significant server infrastructure and server bandwidth (in contrast with clients-server designs with datacenters). However, P2P applications face challenges of security, performance, and reliability due to their highly decentralized structure.

In the jargon of operating systems, it is not actually programs but processes that communicate. A process can be thought of as a program that is running within an end system. When processes are running on the same end system, they can communicate with each other with interprocess communication, using rules that are governed by the end system’s operating system.

Any message sent from one process to another must go through the underlying network. A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a socket. Let’s consider an analogy to help us understand processes and sockets. A process is analogous to a house and its socket is analogous to its door. When a process wants to send a message to another process on another host, it shoves the message out its door (socket). This sending process assumes that there is a transportation infrastructure on the other side of its door that will transport the message to the door of the destination process. Once the message arrives at the destination host, the message passes through the receiving process’s door (socket), and the receiving process then acts on the message

Because other sessions will be sharing the bandwidth along the network path, and because these other sessions will be coming and going, the available throughput can fluctuate with time. These observations lead to another natural service that a transportlayer protocol could provide, namely, guaranteed available throughput at some specified rate. With such a service, the application could request a guaranteed throughput of r bits/sec, and the transport protocol would then ensure that the available throughput is always at least r bits/sec.

FOCUS ON SECURITY SECURING TCP Neither TCP nor UDP provides any encryption—the data that the sending process passes into its socket is the same data that travels over the network to the destination process. So, for example, if the sending process sends a password in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted) into its socket, the cleartext password will travel over all the links between sender and receiver, potentially getting sniffed and discovered at any of the intervening links.

Because privacy and other security issues have become critical for many applications, the Internet community has developed an enhancement for TCP, called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TCP-enhanced-with-SSL not only does everything that traditional TCP does but also provides critical process-to-process security services, including encryption, data integrity, and end-point authentication. We emphasize that SSL is not a third Internet transport protocol, on the same level as TCP and UDP, but instead is an enhancement of TCP, with the enhancements being implemented in the application layer.

Furthermore, messages that do arrive at the receiving process may arrive out of order. UDP does not include a congestion-control mechanism, so the sending side of UDP can pump data into the layer below (the network layer) at any rate it pleases. (Note, however, that the actual end-to-end throughput may be less than this rate due to the limited transmission capacity of intervening links or due to congestion).

The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the Web’s application-layer protocol, is at the heart of the Web. It is defined in [RFC 1945] and [RFC 2616]. HTTP is implemented in two programs: a client program and a server program. The client program and server program, executing on different end systems, talk to each other by exchanging HTTP messages. HTTP defines the structure of these messages and how the client and server exchange the messages. Before explaining HTTP in detail, we should review some Web terminology.

HTTP uses TCP as its underlying transport protocol (rather than running on top of UDP). The HTTP client first initiates a TCP connection with the server. Once the connection is established, the browser and the server processes access TCP through their socket interfaces.

When this client-server interaction is taking place over TCP, the application developer needs to make an important decision—should each request/response pair be sent over a separate TCP connection, or should all of the requests and their corresponding responses be sent over the same TCP connection? In the former approach, the application is said to use non-persistent connections; and in the latter approach, persistent connections.

4. The HTTP server process tells TCP to close the TCP connection. (But TCP doesn’t actually terminate the connection until it knows for sure that the client has received the response message intact.) 5. The HTTP client receives the response message. The TCP connection terminates. The message indicates that the encapsulated object is an HTML file. The client extracts the file from the response message, examines the HTML file, and finds references to the 10 JPEG objects. 6. The first four steps are then repeated for each of the referenced JPEG objects. As the browser receives the Web page, it displays the page to the user. Two different browsers may interpret (that is, display to the user) a Web page in somewhat different ways. HTTP has nothing to do with how a Web page is interpreted by a client.

let’s look at the header lines. The server uses the Connection: close header line to tell the client that it is going to close the TCP connection after sending the message. The Date: header line indicates the time and date when the HTTP response was created and sent by the server. Note that this is not the time when the object was created or last modified; it is the time when the server retrieves the object from its file system,

How does a browser decide which header lines to include in a request message? How does a Web server decide which header lines to include in a response message? A browser will generate header lines as a function of the browser type and version (for example, an HTTP/1.0 browser will not generate any 1.1 header lines), the user configuration of the browser (for example, preferred language), and whether the browser currently has a cached, but possibly out-of-date, version of the object. Web servers behave similarly: There are different products, versions, and configurations, all of which influence which header lines are included in response messages

However, it is often desirable for a Web site to identify users, either because the server wishes to restrict user access or because it wants to serve content as a function of the user identity.

As an example, suppose a browser is requesting the object http://www.someschool.edu/campus.gif. Here is what happens: 1. The browser establishes a TCP connection to the Web cache and sends an HTTP request for the object to the Web cache. 2. The Web cache checks to see if it has a copy of the object stored locally. If it does, the Web cache returns the object within an HTTP response message to the client browser. Figure 2.11 Clients requesting objects through a Web cache 3. If the Web cache does not have the object, the Web cache opens a TCP connection to the origin server, that is, to www.someschool.edu. The Web cache then sends an HTTP request for the object into the cache-to-server TCP connection. After receiving this request, the origin server sends the object within an HTTP response to the Web cache. 4. When the Web cache receives the object, it stores a copy in its local storage and sends a copy, within an HTTP response message, to the client browser (over the existing TCP connection between the client browser and the Web cache). Note that a cache is both a server and a client at the same time. When it receives requests from and sends responses to a browser, it is a server. When it sends requests to and receives responses from an origin server, it is a client.

Fortunately, HTTP has a mechanism that allows a cache to verify that its objects are up to date. This mechanism is called the conditional GET. An HTTP request message is a so-called conditional GET message if (1) the request message uses the GET method and (2) the request message includes an If-Modified-Since: header line.

the cache also stores the last-modified date along with the object. Third, one week later, another browser requests the same object via the cache, and the object is still in the cache. Since this object may have been modified at the Web server in the past week, the cache performs an up-to-date check by issuing a conditional GET.

Although SMTP has numerous wonderful qualities, as evidenced by its ubiquity in the Internet, it is nevertheless a legacy technology that possesses certain archaic characteristics. For example, it restricts the body (not just the headers) of all mail messages to simple 7-bit ASCII. This restriction made sense in the early 1980s when transmission capacity was scarce and no one was e-mailing large attachments or large image, audio, or video files. But today, in the multimedia era, the 7-bit ASCII restriction is a bit of a pain —it requires binary multimedia data to be encoded to ASCII before being sent over SMTP; and it requires the corresponding ASCII message to be decoded back to binary after SMTP transport.

It is important to observe that SMTP does not normally use intermediate mail servers for sending mail, even when the two mail servers are located at opposite ends of the world. If Alice’s server is in Hong Kong and Bob’s server is in St. Louis, the TCP Figure 2.15 Alice sends a message to Bob connection is a direct connection between the Hong Kong and St. Louis servers. In particular, if Bob’s mail server is down, the message remains in Alice’s mail server and waits for a new attempt—the message does not get placed in some intermediate mail server.

First, the client SMTP (running on the sending mail server host) has TCP establish a connection to port 25 at the server SMTP (running on the receiving mail server host). If the server is down, the client tries again later. Once this connection is established, the server and client perform some application-layer handshaking—just as humans often introduce themselves before transferring information from one to another, SMTP clients and servers introduce themselves before transferring information. During this SMTP handshaking phase, the SMTP client indicates the email address of the sender (the person who generated the message) and the e-mail address of the recipient

A second difference, which we alluded to earlier, is that SMTP requires each message, including the body of each message, to be in 7-bit ASCII format. If the message contains characters that are not 7-bit ASCII (for example, French characters with accents) or contains binary data (such as an image file), then the message has to be encoded into 7-bit ASCII. HTTP data does not impose this restriction.

when an e-mail message is sent from one person to another, a header containing peripheral information precedes the body of the message itself. This peripheral information is contained in a series of header lines, which are defined in RFC 5322. The header lines and the body of the message are separated by a blank line (that is, by CRLF). RFC 5322 specifies the exact format for mail header lines as well as their semantic interpretations. As with HTTP, each header line contains readable text, consisting of a keyword followed by a colon followed by a value.

Some of the keywords are required and others are optional. Every header must have a From: header line and a To: header line; a header may include a Subject: header line as well as other optional header lines. It is important to note that these header lines are different from the SMTP commands we studied in Section 2.4.1 (even though they contain some common words such as “from” and “to”). The commands in that section were part of the SMTP handshaking protocol; the header lines examined in this section are part of the mail message itself.

2.3.4 Mail Access Protocols Once SMTP delivers the message from Alice’s mail server to Bob’s mail server, the message is placed in Bob’s mailbox. Throughout this discussion we have tacitly assumed that Bob reads his mail by logging onto the server host and then executing a mail reader that runs on that host. Up until the early 1990s this was the standard way of doing things.

But there is still one missing piece to the puzzle! How does a recipient like Bob, running a user agent on his local PC, obtain his messages, which are sitting in a mail server within Bob’s ISP? Note that Bob’s user agent can’t use SMTP to obtain the messages because obtaining the messages is a pull operation, whereas SMTP is a push protocol. The puzzle is completed by introducing a special mail access protocol that transfers messages from Bob’s mail server to his local PC. There are currently a number of popular mail access protocols, including Post Office Protocol—Version 3 (POP3), Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP), and HTTP

The user agent first asks the mail server to list the size of each of the stored messages. The user agent then retrieves and deletes each message from the server. Note that after the authorization phase, the user agent employed only four commands: list, retr, dele, and quit. The syntax for these commands is defined in RFC 1939. After processing the quit command, the POP3 server enters the update phase and removes messages 1 and 2 from the mailbox.

During a POP3 session between a user agent and the mail server, the POP3 server maintains some state information; in particular, it keeps track of which user messages have been marked deleted. However, the POP3 server does not carry state information across POP3 sessions. This lack of state information across sessions greatly simplifies the implementation of a POP3 server.

IMAP With POP3 access, once Bob has downloaded his messages to the local machine, he can create mail folders and move the downloaded messages into the folders. Bob can then delete messages, move messages across folders, and search for messages (by sender name or subject). But this paradigm— namely, folders and messages in the local machine—poses a problem for the nomadic user, who would prefer to maintain a folder hierarchy on a remote server that can be accessed from any computer. This is not possible with POP3—the POP3 protocol does not provide any means for a user to create remote folders and assign messages to folders. To solve this and other problems, the IMAP protocol, defined in [RFC 3501], was invented. Like POP3, IMAP is a mail access protocol. It has many more features than POP3, but it is also significantly more complex. (And thus the client and server side implementations are significantly more complex.)

An IMAP server will associate each message with a folder; when a message first arrives at the server, it is associated with the recipient’s INBOX folder. The recipient can then move the message into a new, user-created folder, read the message, delete the message, and so on. The IMAP protocol provides commands to allow users to create folders and move messages from one folder to another. IMAP also provides commands that allow users to search remote folders for messages matching specific criteria. Note that, unlike POP3, an IMAP server maintains user state information across IMAP sessions—for example, the names of the folders and which messages are associated with which folders. Another important feature of IMAP is that it has commands that permit a user agent to obtain components of messages. For example, a user agent can obtain just the message header of a message or just one part of a multipart MIME message. This feature is useful when there is a low-bandwidth connection (for example, a slow-speed modem link) between the user agent and its mail server. With a low-bandwidth connection, the user may not want to download all of the messages in its mailbox, particularly avoiding long messages that might contain, for example, an audio or video clip.

Just as humans can be identified in many ways, so too can Internet hosts. One identifier for a host is its hostname. Hostnames—such as www.facebook.com, www.google.com, gaia.cs.umass.edu—are mnemonic and are therefore appreciated by humans. However, hostnames provide little, if any, information about the location within the Internet of the host.

People prefer the more mnemonic hostname identifier, while routers prefer fixed-length, hierarchically structured IP addresses. In order to reconcile these preferences, we need a directory service that translates hostnames to IP addresses. This is the main task of the Internet’s domain name system (DNS). The DNS is (1) a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers, and (2) an application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database. The DNS servers are often UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software [BIND 2016]. The DNS protocol runs over UDP and uses port 53

1. The same user machine runs the client side of the DNS application. 2.

For replicated Web servers, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one canonical hostname. The DNS database contains this set of IP addresses. When clients make a DNS query for a name mapped to a set of addresses, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the ordering of the addresses within each reply. Because a client typically sends its HTTP request message to the IP address that is listed first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among the replicated servers. DNS rotation is also used for e-mail so that multiple mail servers can have the same alias name. Also, content distribution companies such as Akamai have used DNS in more sophisticated ways [Dilley 2002] to provide Web content distribution (see Section 2.6.3). The DNS is specified in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035, and updated in several additional RFCs. It is a complex system, and we only touch upon key aspects of its PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE

A Distributed, Hierarchical Database In order to deal with the issue of scale, the DNS uses a large number of servers, organized in a hierarchical fashion and distributed around the world. No single DNS server has all of the mappings for all of the hosts in the Internet. Instead, the mappings are distributed across the DNS servers.

To a first approximation, there are three classes of DNS servers—root DNS servers, top-level domain (TLD) DNS servers, and authoritative DNS servers—organized in a hierarchy as shown in Figure 2.17. To understand how these three classes of servers interact, suppose a DNS client wants to determine the IP address for the hostname www.amazon.com. To a first Figure 2.17 Portion of the hierarchy of DNS servers approximation, the following events will take place. The client first contacts one of the root servers, which returns IP addresses for TLD servers for the top-level domain com. The client then contacts one of these TLD servers, which returns the IP address of an authoritative server for amazon.com. Finally, the client contacts one of the authoritative servers for amazon.com, which returns the IP address for the hostname www.amazon.com.

An organization’s authoritative DNS server houses these DNS records. An organization can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server to hold these records; alternatively, the organization can pay to have these records stored in an authoritative DNS server of some service provider.

A local DNS server does not strictly belong to the hierarchy of servers but is nevertheless central to the DNS architecture. Each ISP—such as a residential ISP or an institutional ISP—has a local DNS server (also called a default name server). When a host connects to an ISP, the ISP provides the host with the IP addresses of one or more of its local DNS servers (typically through DHCP, which is discussed in Chapter 4 ). You can easily determine the IP address of your local DNS server by accessing network status windows in Windows or UNIX. A host’s local DNS server is typically “close to” the host. For an institutional ISP, the local DNS server may be on the same LAN as the host; for a residential ISP, it is typically separated from the host by no more than a few routers. When a host makes a DNS query, the query is sent to the local DNS server, which acts a proxy, forwarding the query into the DNS server hierarchy, as we’ll discuss in more detail below.

Let’s take a look at a simple example. Suppose the host cse.nyu.edu desires the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu. Also suppose that NYU’s ocal DNS server for cse.nyu.edu is called dns.nyu.edu and that an authoritative DNS server for gaia.cs.umass.edu is called dns.umass.edu. As shown in Figure 2.19, the host cse.nyu.edu first sends a DNS query message to its local DNS server, dns.nyu.edu. The query message contains the hostname to be translated, namely, gaia.cs.umass.edu. The local DNS server forwards the query message to a root DNS server. The root DNS server takes note of the edu suffix and returns to the local DNS server a list of IP addresses for TLD servers responsible for edu. The local DNS server then resends the query message to one of these TLD servers. The TLD server takes note of the umass.edu suffix and responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for the University of Massachusetts, namely, dns.umass.edu. Finally, the local DNS server resends the query message directly to dns.umass.edu, which responds with the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu. Note that in this example, in order to obtain the mapping for one hostname, eight DNS messages were sent: four query messages and four reply messages! We’ll soon see how DNS caching reduces this query traffic. Our previous example assumed that the TLD server knows the authoritative DNS server for the hostname. In general this not always true. Instead, the TLD server Figure 2.19 Interaction of the various DNS servers may know only of an intermediate DNS server, which in turn knows the authoritative DNS server for the hostname

The idea behind DNS caching is very simple. In a query chain, when a DNS server receives a DNS reply (containing, for example, a mapping from a hostname to an IP address), it can cache the mapping in its local memory. For example, in Figure 2.19, each time the local DNS server dns.nyu.edu receives a reply from some DNS server, it can cache any of the information contained in the reply. If a hostname/IP address pair is cached in a DNS server and another query arrives to the DNS server for the same hostname, the DNS server can provide the desired IP address, even if it is not authoritative for the hostname.

The first 12 bytes is the header section, which has a number of fields. The first field is a 16-bit number that identifies the query. This identifier is copied into the reply message to a query, allowing the client to match received replies with sent queries. There are a number of flags in the flag field. A 1-bit query/reply flag indicates whether the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). A 1-bit authoritative flag is Figure 2.21 DNS message format set in a reply message when a DNS server is an authoritative server for a queried name. A 1-bit recursion-desired flag is set when a client (host or DNS server) desires that the DNS server perform recursion when it doesn’t have the record. A 1-bit recursion-available field is set in a reply if the DNS server supports recursion. In the header, there are also four number-of fields. These fields indicate the number of occurrences of the four types of data sections that follow the header. The question section contains information about the query that is being made. This section includes (1) a name field that contains the name that is being queried, and (2) a type field that indicates the type of question being asked about the name—for example, a host address associated with a name (Type A) or the mail server for a name (Type MX). In a reply from a DNS server, the answer section contains the resource records for the name that was originally queried.

How would you like to send a DNS query message directly from the host you’re working on to some DNS server? This can easily be done with the nslookup program, which is available from most Windows and UNIX platforms. For example, from a Windows host, open the Command Prompt and invoke the nslookup program by simply typing “nslookup.” After invoking nslookup, you can send a DNS query to any DNS server (root, TLD, or authoritative). After receiving the reply message from the DNS server, nslookup will display the records included in the reply (in a human-readable format). As an alternative to running nslookup from your own host, you can visit one of many Web sites that allow you to remotely employ nslookup. (Just type “nslookup” into a search engine and you’ll be brought to one of these sites.) The DNS Wireshark lab at the end of this chapter will allow you to explore the DNS in much more detail

In client-server file distribution, the server must send a copy of the file to each of the peers—placing an enormous burden on the server and consuming a large amount of server bandwidth. In P2P file distribution, each peer can redistribute any portion of the file it has received to any other peers, thereby assisting the server in the distribution process. As of 2016, the most popular P2P file distribution protocol is BitTorrent. Originally developed by Bram Cohen, there are now many different independent BitTorrent clients conforming to the BitTorrent protocol, just as there are a number of Web browser clients that conform to the HTTP protocol.

we now consider a simple quantitative model for distributing a file to a fixed set of peers for both architecture types. As shown in Figure 2.22, the server and the peers are connected to the Internet with access links. Denote the upload rate of the server’s access link by u , the upload rate of the ith peer’s access link by u , and the download rate of the ith peer’s access link by d . Also denote the size of the file to be distributed (in bits) by F and the number of peers that want to obtain a copy of the file by N. The distribution time is the time it takes to get Figure 2.22 An illustrative file distribution problem a copy of the file to all N peers. In our analysis of the distribution time below, for both client-server and P2P architectures, we make the simplifying (and generally accurate [Akella 2003]) assumption that the Internet core has abundant bandwidth, implying that all of the bottlenecks are in access networks. We also suppose that the server and clients are not participating in any other network applications, so that all of their upload and download access bandwidth can be fully devoted to distributing this file. Let’s first determine the distribution time for the client-server architecture, which we denote by D . In the client-server architecture, none of the peers aids in distributing the file. We make the following observations: The server must transmit one copy of the file to each of the N peers. Thus the server must transmit NF bits. Since the server’s upload rate is u , the time to distribute the file must be at least NF/u . Let dmin denote the download rate of the peer with the lowest download rate, that is, dmin=min{d1,dp,. . .,dN}. The peer with the lowest download rate cannot obtain all F bits of the file in less than F/dmin seconds. Thus the minimum distribution time is at least F/dmin. Putting these two observations together, we obtain Dcs ≥max{NFus,Fdmin}. This provides a lower bound on the minimum distribution time for the client-server architecture. In the homework problems you will be asked to show that the server can schedule its transmissions so that the lower bound is actually achieved. So let’s take this lower bound provided above as the actual distribution time, that is, Dcs=max{NFus,Fdmin} (2.1) We see from Equation 2.1 that for N large enough, the client-server distribution time is given by NF/u . Thus, the distribution time increases linearly with the number of peers N. So, for example, if the number of peers from one week to the next increases a thousand-fold from a thousand to a million, the time required to distribute the file to all peers increases by 1,000. Let’s now go through a similar analysis for the P2P architecture, where each peer can assist the server in distributing the file. In particular, when a peer receives some file data, it can use its own upload capacity to redistribute the data to other peers. Calculating the distribution time for the P2P architecture is somewhat more complicated than for the client-server architecture, since the distribution time depends on how each peer distributes portions of the file to the other peers. Nevertheless, a simple expression for the minimal distribution time can be obtained [Kumar 2006]. To this end, we first make the following observations: At the beginning of the distribution, only the server has the file. To get this file into the community of peers, the server must send each bit of the file at least once into its access link. Thus, the minimum distribution time is at least F/u . (Unlike the client-server scheme, a bit sent once by the server may not have to be sent by the server again, as the peers may redistribute the bit among themselves.) As with the client-server architecture, the peer with the lowest download rate cannot obtain all F bits of the file in less than F/dmin seconds. Thus the minimum distribution time is at least F/dmin. Finally, observe that the total upload capacity of the system as a whole is equal to the upload rate of the server plus the upload rates of each of the individual peers, that is, utotal=us+u1+⋯+uN. The system must deliver (upload) F bits to each of the N peers, thus delivering a total of NF bits. This cannot be done at a rate faster than utotal. Thus, the minimum distribution time is also at least NF/(us+u1+⋯+uN). Putting these three observations together, we obtain the minimum distribution time for P2P, denoted by DP2P. DP2P≥max{Fus,Fdmin,NFus+∑i=1Nui} (2.2) Equation 2.2 provides a lower bound for the minimum distribution time for the P2P architecture. It turns out that if we imagine that each peer can redistribute a bit as soon as it receives the bit, then there is a redistribution scheme that actually achieves this lower bound [Kumar 2006]. (We will prove a special case of this result in the homework.) In reality, where chunks of the file are redistributed rather than individual bits, Equation 2.2 serves as a good approximation of the actual minimum distribution time. Thus, let’s take the lower bound provided by Equation 2.2 as the actual minimum distribution time, that is, DP2P=max{Fus,Fdmin,NFus+∑i=1Nui} (2.3) Figure 2.23 compares the minimum distribution time for the client-server and P2P architectures assuming that all peers have the same upload rate u. In Figure 2.23, we have set F/u=1 hour, us=10u, and dmin≥us. Thus, a peer can transmit the entire file in one hour, the server transmission rate is 10 times the peer upload rate, Figure 2.23 Distribution time for P2P and client-server architectures and (for simplicity) the peer download rates are set large enough so as not to have an effect. We see from Figure 2.23 that for the client-server architecture, the distribution time increases linearly and without bound as the number of peers increases. However, for the P2P architecture, the minimal distribution time is not only always less than the distribution time of the client-server architecture; it is also less than one hour for any number of peers N. Thus, applications with the P2P architecture can be self-scaling. This scalability is a direct consequence of peers being redistributors as well as consumers of bits

BitTorrent BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution [Chao 2011]. In BitTorrent lingo, the collection of all peers participating in the distribution of a particular file is called a torrent.

Peers in a torrent download equal-size chunks of the file from one another, with a typical chunk size of 256 KBytes. When a peer first joins a torrent, it has no chunks. Over time it accumulates more and more chunks. While it downloads chunks it also uploads chunks to other peers. Once a peer has acquired the entire file, it may (selfishly) leave the torrent, or (altruistically) remain in the torrent and continue to upload chunks to other peers. Also, any peer may leave the torrent at any time with only a subset of chunks, and later rejoin the torrent.

Let’s now take a closer look at how BitTorrent operates. Since BitTorrent is a rather complicated protocol and system, we’ll only describe its most important mechanisms, sweeping some of the details under the rug; this will allow us to see the forest through the trees. Each torrent has an infrastructure node called a tracker. Figure 2.24 File distribution with BitTorrent When a peer joins a torrent, it registers itself with the tracker and periodically informs the tracker that it is still in the torrent. In this manner, the tracker keeps track of the peers that are participating in the torrent. A given torrent may have fewer than ten or more than a thousand peers participating at any instant of time. As shown in Figure 2.24, when a new peer, Alice, joins the torrent, the tracker randomly selects a subset of peers (for concreteness, say 50) from the set of participating peers, and sends the IP addresses of these 50 peers to Alice. Possessing this list of peers, Alice attempts to establish concurrent TCP connections with all the peers on this list. Let’s call all the peers with which Alice succeeds in establishing a TCP connection “neighboring peers.” (In Figure 2.24, Alice is shown to have only three neighboring peers. Normally, she would have many more.) As time evolves, some of these peers may leave and other peers (outside the initial 50) may attempt to establish TCP connections with Alice. So a peer’s neighboring peers will fluctuate over time. At any given time, each peer will have a subset of chunks from the file, with different peers having different subsets. Periodically, Alice will ask each of her neighboring peers (over the TCP connections) for the list of the chunks they have. If Alice has L different neighbors, she will obtain L lists of chunks. With this knowledge, Alice will issue requests (again over the TCP connections) for chunks she currently does not have. So at any given instant of time, Alice will have a subset of chunks and will know which chunks her neighbors have. With this information, Alice will have two important decisions to make. First, which chunks should she request first from her neighbors? And second, to which of her neighbors should she send requested chunks? In deciding which chunks to request, Alice uses a technique called rarest first. The idea is to determine, from among the chunks she does not have, the chunks that are the rarest among her neighbors (that is, the chunks that have the fewest repeated copies among her neighbors) and then request those rarest chunks first. In this manner, the rarest chunks get more quickly redistributed, aiming to (roughly) equalize the numbers of copies of each chunk in the torrent. To determine which requests she responds to, BitTorrent uses a clever trading algorithm. The basic idea is that Alice gives priority to the neighbors that are currently supplying her data at the highest rate. Specifically, for each of her neighbors, Alice continually measures the rate at which she receives bits and determines the four peers that are feeding her bits at the highest rate. She then reciprocates by sending chunks to these same four peers. Every 10 seconds, she recalculates the rates and possibly modifies the set of four peers. In BitTorrent lingo, these four peers are said to be unchoked. Importantly, every 30 seconds, she also picks one additional neighbor at random and sends it chunks. Let’s call the randomly chosen peer Bob. In BitTorrent lingo, Bob is said to be optimistically unchoked. Because Alice is sending data to Bob, she may become one of Bob’s top four uploaders, in which case Bob would start to send data to Alice. If the rate at which Bob sends data to Alice is high enough, Bob could then, in turn, become one of Alice’s top four uploaders. In other words, every 30 seconds, Alice will randomly choose a new trading partner and initiate trading with that partner. If the two peers are satisfied with the trading, they will put each other in their top four lists and continue trading with each other until one of the peers finds a better partner. The effect is that peers capable of uploading at compatible rates tend to find each other. The random neighbor selection also allows new peers to get chunks, so that they can have something to trade. All other neighboring peers besides these five peers (four “top” peers and one probing peer) are “choked,” that is, they do not receive any chunks from Alice. BitTorrent has a number of interesting mechanisms that are not discussed here, including pieces (minichunks), pipelining, random first selection, endgame mode, and anti-snubbing [Cohen 2003]. The incentive mechanism for trading just described is often referred to as tit-for-tat [Cohen 2003]. It has been shown that this incentive scheme can be circumvented [Liogkas 2006; Locher 2006; Piatek

We close our discussion on P2P by briefly mentioning another application of P2P, namely, Distributed Hast Table (DHT). A distributed hash table is a simple database, with the database records being distributed over the peers in a P2P system. DHTs have been widely implemented (e.g., in BitTorrent) and have been the subject of extensive research. An overview is provided in a Video Note in the companion website.

2.6.1 Internet Video In streaming stored video applications, the underlying medium is prerecorded video, such as a movie, a television show, a prerecorded sporting event, or a prerecorded user-generated video (such as those commonly seen on YouTube). These prerecorded videos are placed on servers, and users send requests to the servers to view the videos on demand. Many Internet companies today provide streaming video, including, Netflix, YouTube (Google), Amazon, and Youku. But before launching into a discussion of video streaming, we should first get a quick feel for the video medium itself. A video is a sequence of images, typically being displayed at a constant rate, for example, at 24 or 30 images per second. An uncompressed, digitally encoded image consists of an array of pixels, with each pixel encoded into a number of bits to represent luminance and color. An important characteristic of video is that it can be compressed, thereby trading off video quality with bit rate. Today’s off-the-shelf compression algorithms can compress a video to essentially any bit rate desired. Of course, the higher the bit rate, the better the image quality and the better the overall user viewing experience.

In HTTP streaming, the video is simply stored at an HTTP server as an ordinary file with a specific URL. When a user wants to see the video, the client establishes a TCP connection with the server and issues an HTTP GET request for that URL. The server then sends the video file, within an HTTP response message, as quickly as the underlying network protocols and traffic conditions will allow. On the client side, the bytes are collected in a client application buffer. Once the number of bytes in this buffer exceeds a predetermined threshold, the client application begins playback—specifically, the streaming video application periodically grabs video frames from the client application buffer, decompresses the frames, and displays them on the user’s screen. Thus, the video streaming application is displaying video as it is receiving and buffering frames corresponding to latter parts of the video

Although HTTP streaming, as described in the previous paragraph, has been extensively deployed in practice (for example, by YouTube since its inception), it has a major shortcoming: All clients receive the same encoding of the video, despite the large variations in the amount of bandwidth available to a client, both across different clients and also over time for the same client. This has led to the development of a new type of HTTP-based streaming, often referred to as Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). In DASH, the video is encoded into several different versions, with each version having a different bit rate and, correspondingly, a different quality level. The client dynamically requests chunks of video segments of a few seconds in length. When the amount of available bandwidth is high, the client naturally selects chunks from a high-rate version; and when the available bandwidth is low, it naturally selects from a low-rate version. The client selects different chunks one at a time with HTTP GET request messages [Akhshabi 2011

DASH allows clients with different Internet access rates to stream in video at different encoding rates. Clients with low-speed 3G connections can receive a low bit-rate (and low-quality) version, and clients with fiber connections can receive a high-quality version.

With DASH, each video version is stored in the HTTP server, each with a different URL. The HTTP server also has a manifest file, which provides a URL for each version along with its bit rate. The client first requests the manifest file and learns about the various versions. The client then selects one chunk at a time by specifying a URL and a byte range in an HTTP GET request message for each chunk. While downloading chunks, the client also measures the received bandwidth and runs a rate determination algorithm to select the chunk to request next.

Bring Home. A second design philosophy, taken by Limelight and many other CDN companies, is to bring the ISPs home by building large clusters at a smaller number (for example, tens) of sites. Instead of getting inside the access ISPs, these CDNs typically place their clusters in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) (see Section 1.3). Compared with the enter-deep design philosophy, the bring-home design typically results in lower maintenance and management overhead, possibly at the expense of higher delay and lower throughput to end users. Once its clusters are in place, the CDN replicates content across its clusters. The CDN may not want to place a copy of every video in each cluster, since some videos are rarely viewed or are only popular in some countries

Google’s CDN infrastructure has three tiers of server clusters: Fourteen “mega data centers,” with eight in North America, four in Europe, and two in Asia [Google Locations 2016], with each data center having on the order of 100,000 servers. These mega data centers are responsible for serving dynamic (and often personalized) content, including search results and Gmail messages. An estimated 50 clusters in IXPs scattered throughout the world, with each cluster consisting on the order of 100–500 servers [Adhikari 2011a]. These clusters are responsible for serving static content, including YouTube videos [Adhikari 2011a]. Many hundreds of “enter-deep” clusters located within an access ISP. Here a cluster typically consists of tens of servers within a single rack. These enter-deep servers perform TCP splitting (see Section 3.7) and serve static content [Chen 2011], including the static portions of Web pages that embody search results

As indicated earlier, the Web pages for browsing the Netflix video library are served from servers in the Amazon cloud. When a user selects a movie to play, the Netflix software, running in the Amazon cloud, first determines which of its CDN servers have copies of the movie. Among the servers that have the movie, the software then determines the “best” server for that client request. If the client is using a residential ISP that has a Netflix CDN server rack installed in that ISP, and this rack has a copy of the requested movie, then a server in this rack is typically selected. If not, a server at a nearby IXP is typically selected.

Once Netflix determines the CDN server that is to deliver the content, it sends the client the IP address of the specific server as well as a manifest file, which has the URLs for the different versions of the requested movie. The client and that CDN server then directly interact using a proprietary version of DASH. Specifically, as described in Section 2.6.2, the client uses the byte-range header in HTTP GET request messages, to request chunks from the different versions of the movie.

Netflix embodies many of the key principles discussed earlier in this section, including adaptive streaming and CDN distribution. However, because Netflix uses its own private CDN, which distributes only video (and not Web pages), Netflix has been able to simplify and tailor its CDN design. In particular, Netflix does not need to employ DNS redirect, as discussed in Section 2.6.3, to connect a particular client to a CDN server; instead, the Netflix software (running in the Amazon cloud) directly tells the client to use a particular CDN server. Furthermore, the Netflix CDN uses push caching rather than pull caching (Section 2.2.5): content is pushed into the servers at scheduled times at off-peak hours, rather than dynamically during cache misses.

YouTube makes extensive use of CDN technology to distribute its videos [Torres 2011]. Similar to Netflix, Google uses its own private CDN to distribute YouTube videos, and has installed server clusters in many hundreds of different IXP and ISP locations. From these locations and directly from its huge data centers, Google distributes YouTube videos [Adhikari 2011a]. Unlike Netflix, however, Google uses pull caching, as described in Section 2.2.5, and DNS redirect, as described in Section 2.6.3. Most of the time, Google’s cluster-selection strategy directs the client to the cluster for which the RTT between client and cluster is the lowest; however, in order to balance the load across clusters, sometimes the client is directed (via DNS) to a more distant cluster [Torres

YouTube employs HTTP streaming, often making a small number of different versions available for a video, each with a different bit rate and corresponding quality level. YouTube does not employ adaptive streaming (such as DASH), but instead requires the user to manually select a version. In order to save bandwidth and server resources that would be wasted by repositioning or early termination, YouTube uses the HTTP byte range request to limit the flow of transmitted data after a target amount of video is prefetched. Several million videos are uploaded to YouTube every day. Not only are YouTube videos streamed from server to client over HTTP, but YouTube uploaders also upload their videos from client to server over HTTP. YouTube processes each video it receives, converting it to a YouTube video format and creating multiple versions at different bit rates. This processing takes place entirely within Google data centers.

We conclude this section by describing an entirely different approach for providing video on demand over the Internet at a large scale—one that allows the service provider to significantly reduce its infrastructure and bandwidth costs. As you might suspect, this approach uses P2P delivery instead of (or along with) client-server delivery. Since 2011, Kankan (owned and operated by Xunlei) has been deploying P2P video delivery with great success, with tens of millions of users every month [Zhang 2015]. At a high level, P2P video streaming is very similar to BitTorrent file downloading. When a peer wants to see a video, it contacts a tracker to discover other peers in the system that have a copy of that video. This requesting peer then requests chunks of the video in parallel from the other peers that have the video. Different from downloading with BitTorrent, however, requests are preferentially made for chunks that are to be played back in the near future in order to ensure continuous playback [Dhungel 2012]. Recently, Kankan has migrated to a hybrid CDN-P2P streaming system [Zhang 2015]. Specifically, Kankan now deploys a few hundred servers within China and pushes video content to these servers. This Kankan CDN plays a major role in the start-up stage of video streaming. In most cases, the client requests the beginning of the content from CDN servers, and in parallel requests content from peers. When the total P2P traffic is sufficient for video playback, the client will cease streaming from the CDN and only stream from peers. But if the P2P streaming traffic becomes insufficient, the client will restart CDN connections and return to the mode of hybrid CDN-P2P streaming. In this manner, Kankan can ensure short initial start-up delays while minimally relying on costly infrastructure servers and bandwidth.

There are two types of network applications. One type is an implementation whose operation is specified in a protocol standard, such as an RFC or some other standards document; such an application is sometimes referred to as “open,” since the rules specifying its operation are known to all. For such an implementation, the client and server programs must conform to the rules dictated by the RFC. For example, the client program could be an implementation of the client side of the HTTP protocol, described in Section 2.2 and precisely defined in RFC 2616; similarly, the server program could be an implementation of the HTTP server protocol, also precisely defined in RFC 2616. If one developer writes code for the client program and another developer writes code for the server program, and both developers carefully follow the rules of the RFC, then the two programs will be able to interoperate.

The other type of network application is a proprietary network application. In this case the client and server programs employ an application-layer protocol that has not been openly published in an RFC or elsewhere. A single developer (or development team) creates both the client and server programs, and the developer has complete control over what goes in the code. But because the code does not implement an open protocol, other independent developers will not be able to develop code that interoperates with the application.

During the development phase, one of the first decisions the developer must make is whether the application is to run over TCP or over UDP. Recall that TCP is connection oriented and provides a reliable byte-stream channel through which data flows between two end systems. UDP is connectionless and sends independent packets of data from one end system to the other, without any guarantees about delivery. Recall also that when a client or server program implements a protocol defined by an RFC, it should use the well-known port number associated with the protocol; conversely, when developing a proprietary application, the developer must be careful to avoid using such well-known port numbers. (Port numbers were briefly discussed in Section 2.1. They are covered in more detail in Chapter 3.) We introduce UDP and TCP socket programming by way of a simple UDP application and a simple TCP application. We present the simple UDP and TCP applications in Python 3. We could have written the code in Java, C, or C++, but we chose Python mostly because Python clearly exposes the key socket concepts.

With the TCP connection established, when one side wants to send data to the other side, it just drops the data into the TCP connection via its socket. This is different from UDP, for which the server must attach a destination address to the packet before dropping it into the socket. Now let’s take a closer look at the interaction of client and server programs in TCP. The client has the job of initiating contact with the server. In order for the server to be able to react to the client’s initial contact, the server has to be ready. This implies two things. First, as in the case of UDP, the TCP server must be running as a process before the client attempts to initiate contact. Second, the server program must have a special door—more precisely, a special socket—that welcomes some initial contact from a client process running on an arbitrary host. Using our house/door analogy for a process/socket, we will sometimes refer to the client’s initial contact as “knocking on the welcoming door.” With the server process running, the client process can initiate a TCP connection to the server. This is done in the client program by creating a TCP socket. When the client creates its TCP socket, it specifies the address of the welcoming socket in the server, namely, the IP address of the server host and the port number of the socket. After creating its socket, the client initiates a three-way handshake and establishes a TCP connection with the server. The three-way handshake, which takes place within the transport layer, is completely invisible to the client and server programs.

In our example below, the welcoming door is a TCP socket object that we call serverSocket; the newly created socket dedicated to the client making the connection is called connectionSocket. Students who are encountering TCP sockets for the first time sometimes confuse the welcoming socket (which is the initial point of contact for all clients wanting to communicate with the server), and each newly created server-side connection socket that is subsequently created for communicating with each client.

From the application’s perspective, the client’s socket and the server’s connection socket are directly connected by a pipe. As shown in Figure 2.28, the client process can send arbitrary bytes into its socket, and TCP guarantees that the server process will receive (through the connection socket) each byte in the order sent. TCP thus provides a reliable service between the client and server processes. Furthermore, just as people can go in and out the same door, the client process not only sends bytes into but also receives bytes from its socket; similarly, the server process not only receives bytes from but also sends bytes into its connection socket.

For example, if the postal service doesn’t provide a maximum bound on how long it can take to deliver mail between the two houses (for example, three days), then there is no way that Ann and Bill can guarantee a maximum delay for mail delivery between any of the cousin pairs. In a similar manner, the services that a transport protocol can provide are often constrained by the service model of the underlying network-layer protocol. If the network-layer protocol cannot provide delay or bandwidth guarantees for transport-layer segments sent between hosts, then the transport-layer protocol cannot provide delay or bandwidth guarantees for application messages sent between processes.

First recall from Section 2.7 that a process (as part of a network application) can have one or more sockets, doors through which data passes from the network to the process and through which data passes from the process to the network. Thus, as shown in Figure 3.2, the transport layer in the receiving host does not actually deliver data directly to a process, but instead to an intermediary socket. Because at any given time there can be more than one socket in the receiving host, each socket has a unique identifier. The format of the identifier depends on whether the socket is a UDP or a TCP socket, as we’ll discuss shortly. Now let’s consider how a receiving host directs an incoming transport-layer segment to the appropriate socket. Each transport-layer segment has a set of fields in the segment for this purpose. At the receiving end, the transport layer examines these fields to identify the receiving socket and then directs the segment to that socket. This job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket is called demultiplexing.

Connectionless Multiplexing and Demultiplexing Recall from Section 2.7.1 that the Python program running in a host can create a UDP socket with the line clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM) When a UDP socket is created in this manner, the transport layer automatically assigns a port number to the socket. In particular, the transport layer assigns a port number in the range 1024 to 65535 that is currently not being used by any other UDP port in the host. Alternatively, we can add a line into our Python program after we create the socket to associate a specific port number (say, 19157) to this UDP socket via the socket bind() method: clientSocket.bind((’’, 19157)) If the application developer writing the code were implementing the server side of a “well-known protocol,” then the developer would have to assign the corresponding well-known port number. Typically, the client side of the application lets the transport layer automatically (and transparently) assign the port number, whereas the server side of the application assigns a specific port number.

It is important to note that a UDP socket is fully identified by a two-tuple consisting of a destination IP address and a destination port number. As a consequence, if two UDP segments have different source IP addresses and/or source port numbers, but have the same destination IP address and destination port number, then the two segments will be directed to the same destination process via the same destination socket.

As shown in Figure 3.4, in the A-to-B segment the source port number serves as part of a “return address”—when B wants to send a segment back to A, the destination port in the B-to-A segment will take its value from the source port value of the A-to-B segment.

Connection-Oriented Multiplexing and Demultiplexing In order to understand TCP demultiplexing, we have to take a close look at TCP sockets and TCP connection establishment. One subtle difference between a TCP socket and a UDP socket is that a TCP socket is identified by a four-tuple: (source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number). Thus, when a TCP segment arrives from the network to a host, the host uses all four values to direct (demultiplex) the segment to the appropriate socket. Figure 3.4 The inversion of source and destination port numbers In particular, and in contrast with UDP, two arriving TCP segments with different source IP addresses or source port numbers will (with the exception of a TCP segment carrying the original connectionestablishment request) be directed to two different sockets. To gain further insight, let’s reconsider the TCP client-server programming example in Section 2.7.2: The TCP server application has a “welcoming socket,” that waits for connection-establishment requests from TCP clients (see Figure 2.29) on port number 12000. The TCP client creates a socket and sends a connection establishment request segment with the lines: clientSocket

Also, the transport layer at the server notes the following four values in the connection-request segment: (1) the source port number in the segment, (2) the IP address of the source host, (3) the destination port number in the segment, and (4) its own IP address.

FOCUS ON SECURITY Port Scanning We’ve seen that a server process waits patiently on an open port for contact by a remote client. Some ports are reserved for well-known applications (e.g., Web, FTP, DNS, and SMTP servers); other ports are used by convention by popular applications (e.g., the Microsoft 2000 SQL server listens for requests on UDP port 1434). Thus, if we determine that a port is open on a host, we may be able to map that port to a specific application running on the host.

This is very useful for system administrators, who are often interested in knowing which network applications are running on the hosts in their networks. But attackers, in order to “case the joint,” also want to know which ports are open on target hosts. If a host is found to be running an application with a known security flaw (e.g., a SQL server listening on port 1434 was subject to a buffer overflow, allowing a remote user to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable host, a flaw exploited by the Slammer worm [CERT 2003–04]), then that host is ripe for attack.

Determining which applications are listening on which ports is a relatively easy task. Indeed there are a number of public domain programs, called port scanners, that do just that. Perhaps the most widely used of these is nmap, freely available at http://nmap.org and included in most Linux distributions. For TCP, nmap sequentially scans ports, looking for ports that are accepting TCP connections. For UDP, nmap again sequentially scans ports, looking for UDP ports that respond to transmitted UDP segments. In both cases, nmap returns a list of open, closed, or unreachable ports

Before closing this discussion, it’s instructive to say a few additional words about Web servers and how they use port numbers. Consider a host running a Web server, such as an Apache Web server, on port 80. When clients (for example, browsers) send segments to the server, all segments will have destination port 80. In particular, both the initial connection-establishment segments and the segments carrying HTTP request messages will have destination port 80. As we have just described, the server distinguishes the segments from the different clients using source IP addresses and source port numbers

But as we learned in the previous section, we have to do a little more than nothing! At the very least, the transport layer has to provide a multiplexing/demultiplexing service in order to pass data between the network layer and the correct application-level process.

UDP, defined in [RFC 768], does just about as little as a transport protocol can do. Aside from the multiplexing/demultiplexing function and some light error checking, it adds nothing to IP.

DNS is an example of an application-layer protocol that typically uses UDP. When the DNS application in a host wants to make a query, it constructs a DNS query message and passes the message to UDP. Without performing any handshaking with the UDP entity running on the destination end system, the host-side UDP adds header fields to the message and passes the resulting segment to the network layer. The network layer encapsulates the UDP segment into a datagram and sends the datagram to a name server.

Finer application-level control over what data is sent, and when. Under UDP, as soon as an application process passes data to UDP, UDP will package the data inside a UDP segment and immediately pass the segment to the network layer. TCP, on the other hand, has a congestioncontrol mechanism that throttles the transport-layer TCP sender when one or more links between the source and destination hosts become excessively congested. TCP will also continue to resend a segment until the receipt of the segment has been acknowledged by the destination, regardless of how long reliable delivery takes. Since real-time applications often require a minimum sending rate, do not want to overly delay segment transmission, and can tolerate some data loss, TCP’s service model is not particularly well matched to these applications’ needs. As discussed below, these applications can use UDP and implement, as part of the application, any additional functionality that is needed beyond UDP’s no-frills segment-delivery service. No connection establishment. As we’ll discuss later, TCP uses a three-way handshake before it starts to transfer data. UDP just blasts away without any formal preliminaries. Thus UDP does not introduce any delay to establish a connection. This is probably the principal reason why DNS runs over UDP rather than TCP—DNS would be much slower if it ran over TCP. HTTP uses TCP rather than UDP, since reliability is critical for Web pages with text. But, as we briefly discussed in Section 2.2, the TCP connection-establishment delay in HTTP is an important contributor to the delays associated with downloading Web documents. Indeed, the QUIC protocol (Quick UDP Internet Connection, [Iyengar 2015]), used in Google’s Chrome browser, uses UDP as its underlying transport protocol and implements reliability in an application-layer protocol on top of UDP.

No connection state. TCP maintains connection state in the end systems. This connection state includes receive and send buffers, congestion-control parameters, and sequence and acknowledgment number parameters. We will see in Section 3.5 that this state information is needed to implement TCP’s reliable data transfer service and to provide congestion control. UDP, on the other hand, does not maintain connection state and does not track any of these parameters. For this reason, a server devoted to a particular application can typically support many more active clients when the application runs over UDP rather than TCP.

Furthermore, real-time applications, like Internet phone and video conferencing, react very poorly to TCP’s congestion control. For these reasons, developers of multimedia applications may choose to run their applications over UDP instead of TCP. When packet loss rates are low, and with some organizations blocking UDP traffic for security reasons (see Chapter 8), TCP becomes an increasingly attractive protocol for streaming media transport.

congestion control. But congestion control is needed to prevent the network from entering a congested state in which very little useful work is done. If everyone were to start streaming high-bit-rate video without using any congestion control, there would be so much packet overflow at routers that very few UDP packets would successfully traverse the source-to-destination path.

Thus, the lack of congestion control in UDP can result in high loss rates between a UDP sender and receiver, and the crowding out of TCP sessions—a potentially serious problem [Floyd 1999]. Many researchers have proposed new mechanisms to force all sources, including UDP sources, to perform adaptive congestion control [Mahdavi 1997; Floyd 2000; Kohler 2006: RFC 4340].

Moreover, the high loss rates induced by the uncontrolled UDP senders would cause the TCP senders (which, as we’ll see, do decrease their sending rates in the face of congestion) to dramatically decrease their rates

The checksum is used by the receiving host to check whether errors have been introduced into the segment. In truth, the checksum is also calculated over a few of the fields in the IP header in addition to the UDP segment. But we ignore this detail in order to see the forest through the trees.

As an example, suppose that we have the following three 16-bit words: 0110011001100000 0101010101010101 1000111100001100 The sum of first two of these 16-bit words is 0110011001100000 0101010101010101 1011101110110101 Adding the third word to the above sum gives 1011101110110101 1000111100001100 0100101011000010 Note that this last addition had overflow, which was wrapped around. The 1s complement is obtained by converting all the 0s to 1s and converting all the 1s to 0s. Thus the 1s complement of the sum converting all the 0s to 1s and converting all the 1s to 0s. Thus the 1s complement of the sum bit words are added, including the checksum.

If no errors are introduced into the packet, then clearly the sum at the receiver will be 1111111111111111. If one of the bits is a 0, then we know that errors have been introduced into the packet. You may wonder why UDP provides a checksum in the first place, as many link-layer protocols (including the popular Ethernet protocol) also provide error checking. The reason is that there is no guarantee that all the links between source and destination provide error checking; that is, one of the links may use a link-layer protocol that does not provide error checking. Furthermore, even if segments are correctly transferred across a link, it’s possible that bit errors could be introduced when a segment is stored in a router’s memory. Given that neither link-by-link reliability nor in-memory error detection is guaranteed, UDP must provide error detection at the transport layer, on an end-end basis, if the endend data transfer service is to provide error detection. This is an example of the celebrated end-end principle in system design [Saltzer 1984], which states that since certain functionality (error detection, in this case) must be implemented on an end-end basis: “functions placed at the lower levels may be redundant or of little value when compared to the cost of providing them at the higher level.

The finite-state machine (FSM) definitions for the rdt1.0 sender and receiver are shown in Figure 3.9.

If the message taker hears a garbled sentence, you’re asked to repeat the garbled sentence. This message-dictation protocol uses both positive acknowledgments (“OK”) and negative acknowledgments (“Please repeat that.”). These control messages allow the receiver to let the sender know what has been received correctly, and what has been received in error and thus requires repeating. In a computer network setting, reliable data transfer protocols based on such retransmission are known as ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocols.

Sigmund Freud, the father of modern psychology, urged people to regard God as an illusion, nothing more. He said our concept of God only symbolized an infantile desire for a father figure, and we should outgrow this desire. Science should replace God, Freud decreed, explaining: “Science is not an illusion. But it would be an illusion to suppose that we could get anywhere else what it cannot give us.”

Academics Academics are one area where the rescue trap can catch people. Parents get caught up in the hysteria that every grade and every assignment will impact their child’s chances of getting into a choice college. This fear leads parents to attempt to rescue their children, which results in the parents avoiding very important teaching opportunities. For example, a seventh-grade history teacher recently shared with us a situation with a student who failed a test because he did not study. The teacher received a call from the mother of the student who asked what her son could do to raise his grade, to which the teacher replied, “Study.”

The student in question did not work hard although he was challenged by the class. This scenario involved a student who was doing minimal work and a parent who saw the letter grade as more important than the skills learned earning the grade. This parent had good intentions—to make something easier for her son—but missed a valuable opportunity to teach him the importance of hard work, not to mention planning, organization, and responsibility, because she was focused on the objective grade.

Social Situations Another area we see parents commonly falling into the rescue trap is when they see their children struggling with their peers. Whether their children have a peer conflict or parents feel like their children are being excluded, even the most well-intentioned parents find themselves trying to resolve their children’s peer issues rather than let them work the issues out on their own or helping their children come up with a resolution.

Yet the temptation to make a situation better for their child is so strong that parents can’t help themselves from intervening—for example, they start calling the parents of the other children, setting up apologies, and forcing children to be friends again. Most parents don’t even realize they have fallen in the trap. This situation is quite common for parents.

Parents attempt other social rescues too. These include buying children the top brand-name clothes or electronic gadget so they will be accepted by their friends. When parents simply purchase things for their children because their child says “all the other kids” have them, parents are rescuing their children from a chance to figure out how to deal with a social dilemma—in this case, feeling left out among their peers.

I was planning a sleepover with my friends all week where we were going to do each other’s makeup, hair, and do facials, and my mom almost ruined it.” It turns out her parents didn’t know about the sleepover or how much effort it would require to purchase the specific beauty supplies from several different stores. The Friday afternoon of the sleepover, the girl sent her mother a text saying she needed her mom to take her to the store to buy supplies. Mom did not see the text because she was at an appointment. Later that night, the girl yelled at her mother for ruining the sleepover, because she would not have time to get the supplies before her softball practice. The mom ended up going to several stores and canceling her afternoon plans so that she could immediately meet her daughter’s needs, which were poorly planned in the first place.

Teach the Lessons Early At what age is it appropriate to begin to teach self-discipline through delayed gratification? Infants depend on care providers to meet their needs immediately. If they are hungry, they should be fed; if they are wet, they should be changed; if they have gas, they should be burped. As infants develop into toddlers, their “needs” expand into “wants,” and then the bait-and-switch technique becomes a parent’s go-to survival response. If a toddler wants to play with your keys but you need to drive the car, you distract the child with another toy and sneak the keys away.

But if a six-year-old or a twelve-year-old child says, “I want milk,” he is very capable of waiting. Similarly, if your two-year-old child is absolutely taken with a toy at your neighbor’s house, you may go out the next day to buy the toy for your child. However, if you do that for your four-year-old or ten-year-old child, you are encouraging the expectation for instant gratification.

As children get older, the verbal expectation for them to wait can be more direct. For example, you may say to a three-and-a-half-year-old child, “OK, let’s wait and count to ten” or “OK, I can do that when I put these three groceries away.” Kids can very quickly grow wary of the phrase “in a minute,” so it is best to choose another way to show them the time to wait.

Parents want their children to feel confident and good about themselves, so they encourage extra enrichment to push them ahead. For example, if they are not at the top levels, children receive tutoring to move them higher in the class, and young athletes receive individual coaching to become the best player on the team.

It is an alluring trap for parents to push their children ahead and “give” their children all the advantages. Their intention is to help their children to be their best. While they want to offer their children support, the message is interpreted as “You are not good enough, and you need to be better.”

There’s no doubt about it: today’s parents are extremely busy. There are also more families with two parents working full-time. A very common phenomenon that we see is parents give in to their children because they feel guilty about not being more available.

Consider the child who says, “Mom, I didn’t like what you packed me for lunch, so I didn’t eat it and now I am really hungry. We need to stop and get food on the way home.” For many of us, this touches the guilt button. My child skipped lunch and now doesn’t feel good because I didn’t pack food she likes. To ease the child’s discomfort and the parent’s guilt, it would be easy to stop and get food on the way home.

Watch from across the room as your child navigates his way to the restroom, or let him walk the last two blocks to school alone (you can even monitor from your car), or sit across the park as he plays with the other children. But remember, watch from afar and don’t meddle in the challenges that may arise. If your child gets lost, watch and see how he figures out how to find you before you step in. This requires patience, but as you watch your child figure out what to do, maybe you will also develop more confidence in him.

When you see your toddler struggling to put on a shoe, it may be tempting to do it for her, particularly when you are in a hurry or late for an appointment. This can then extend to the preschool child who didn’t finish the art project—perhaps you just need to add that last finishing touch. This is how the pattern of rescuing children begins.

People process information more fully if it is meaningful to them. Think about every time you ask your child to pick his towel off the floor after a shower. If every time you see the towel on the floor you say, “You need to hang up the towel,” and then put it on the hook yourself, your child is not likely to ever do it.

Putting It All Together The Issue Parents hate seeing their children upset or anxious. They want to do everything they can to prevent them from having a negative experience. The Trap Parents have the ability to solve many of their children’s problems easily and quickly. This solves the problems with fewer tears, arguments, and possibly a more positive outcome. But remember, this deprives them of essential practice. The Alternative Resist the temptation to rescue children and teens. Allow them to come up with the solutions to resolve problems. 1. Make waiting the rule, not the exception. Begin this expectation when they are young. When your toddler, child, or teen makes a request, take your time in responding to the request. Adjust the wait time depending on the age of the child. 2. Find regular opportunities for your children to do things on their own without your assistance. 3. Allow children to grapple with finding the solutions to problems. Be available as a sounding board, but don’t jump in to offer the easy answer. And don’t rework their solution if it is not perfect. It probably won’t be, and that’s OK. 4. Let children take chances. As long as personal safety isn’t involved, one of the best ways to learn about problem solving is to get experience doing it.

Ask questions after the fact. Feel free to go over what happened and ask what they might do differently next time. 6. Allow children to experience natural consequences to their actions and choices. Experiencing the consequences will be memorable and is what will encourage them to do it differently the next time.

Embracing the challenges of parenting allows a more open and honest disclosure of the trials and tribulations that accompany parenting. When parents are lucky enough to have a group of peers who are comfortable sharing their insecurities, it takes away the expectation that everything has to be perfect. One of my most comforting moments happened when I dropped off my son at preschool and a mom greeted me with a laugh and said, “Don’t get too close. It was such a crazy morning I forgot to brush my teeth.” What a relief to know other parents rush around forgetting basic things too. She is now one of my closest friends.

It is important to refrain from including your children in adult discussions about important decisions. A child does not need to hear her parents’ negative opinions about her teachers, coaches, friends, and so on. She does not need to hear all the what-if possibilities either. When children hear these discussions, they may learn that it’s OK to point out the imperfections of others.

Become a Great Listener When your child comes to you with a problem, don’t fall into the trap of providing the solution. It is natural to want to soothe your child’s hurt feelings and make things better, but doing so provides only a temporary fix. Your first response should be to listen. As therapists, we often hear children say that they don’t talk to their parents about issues because they “won’t understand” or “won’t listen.”

To be a great listener, keep the following skills in mind: • Don’t talk right away. Instead, make attentive eye contact. There will be time for basic questions later. • Be patient; you can’t rush the story. • Appear interested, such as nodding your head. Put down the phone and remove any distractions. • Pay attention to what is, and isn’t, being said. Your child’s body language may give you some clues. Is your child talking quickly, folding his or her arms or looking down, leaving things out of the story, and so on? • Ask for basic clarification when needed. When your child is done talking, be supportive. For example, say, “Thanks for sharing. It seems like you have a lot going on right now. Let me know if you think I can do anything to help.”

But sometimes we have to remind parents about what is developmentally typical for their child’s age, such as when parents ask for their children to be more insightful, perceptive, and mature than most children are at that age.

The key here, as it is with all the theories, is that the child must experience the challenge. Take, for example, staying with a babysitter for the first time or deciding whom to eat lunch with on the first day of school. Both experiences are anxiety provoking and can result in either needing more practice or feeling good about the experience. Children are not required to master a challenge once; rather they develop their ability to master it over years

If children have positive experiences and learn from the challenge, they progress to the next stage feeling confident in their skills. If children fail to master the challenge, they move on at a disadvantage, either with less confidence or with a misguided understanding of their role in social interactions. Children may continue to age physically, but socially and emotionally, they may be at a different stage than their peers. The following are brief summaries of Erikson’s psychosocial stages. You will see how development progresses naturally for most children.

1. Infancy: Erikson’s first stage is infancy, which typically lasts from birth to eighteen months. The basic conflict encountered during this stage is called trust vs. mistrust. This fundamental stage revolves around basic needs; the infant is completely dependent on his caregiver for food, reliable care, and affection. The infant successfully builds trust if his caregiver is dependable, whereas inconsistent or emotionally unavailable caregivers will foster mistrust in the infant. If a child progresses through this stage with positive experiences, he will be more likely to trust others as he gets older. 2. Early Childhood: The second stage is early childhood, which typically lasts from eighteen months to three years of age. The basic conflict at this stage is autonomy vs. shame and doubt. Children strive toward the development of a sense of independence and personal control over their environment and their own body. For example, a typical developmental step at this stage would be toilet training, which exemplifies control of one’s own body and a sense of independence. You can see this fight for independence play out every day—such as when the child decides she suddenly doesn’t like a certain food or doesn’t want to nap. Another example might be the child who wants to walk up the stairs rather than be carried or get himself into his own car seat. If children do not begin to do things for themselves or they are prevented from doing so, they can develop a sense of shame and doubt about their ability to be independent and self-reliant. We all know there are times when it is just not possible to let toddlers do everything on their own. Doing something for your child is typical and will not impact this stage. Only when parents choose most of the time to do things for their children, rather than allow the toddler to develop a sense of autonomy, does this pose a problem. 3. Preschool: Erikson’s third stage typically lasts from about three years old to five or six years old. The basic conflict at this age is called initiative vs. guilt. Independence and one’s desire for exploration develop in this stage. Children begin to exert power over their environment by manipulating things around them. We see this opportunity for development during their play. Does a child initiate play or wait for other children to decide what they are going to do? Does the child share toys or take them and leave the area so others can’t have them? They become more assertive and begin to initiate events rather than passively wait for things to happen to them. When taking the initiative is successful, the child feels a sense of mastery and confidence, but the child who exerts too much or too little power may meet disapproval leading to feelings of guilt. Most often children don’t know why their attempt at taking control was not accepted by others, but they feel bad or guilty that it wasn’t successful. With practice, the child learns how to take initiative successfully. As

4. School Age: Erikson’s fourth stage is thought to prevail from the ages of six to twelve years old. During this stage of development, the basic conflict is called industry vs. inferiority, and the important challenges and opportunities for development at this stage center on school.

A couple came to a session concerned that their son had told them many of his friends at school were swearing. The parents said that they told their child not to spend time with those friends at school and that they didn’t think he should play together with those kids after school. I told them two things. First, it is typical for kids to experiment with swearing at that age. Second, it is so wonderful that their child is telling them this so they can help him navigate this new experience, not avoid it, or try to figure it out all alone. They can now help their son talk about why some kids swear, why adults don’t want them to, and what he is going to do. If their child decides to swear too and does it around adults, he will experience the natural consequences that follow, but hopefully he will know the consequences as a result of having discussed this with them. This is a great learning experience. Trying to avoid any experience a parent thinks is “inappropriate” is futile and doesn’t help a child learn.

Most five-year-old children don’t know how to consider the perspective of others. Therefore, when they are asked to say “sorry” they only know it is admitting they did something wrong, which makes them feel shameful and anxious. They haven’t developed the ability to understand that saying sorry is more about helping the other person feel better.

The Alternative Be aware of where your children fall in each developmental level and have reasonable expectations for them at every age. As children are moving through each stage, parents can foster learning experiences and challenges that are stage appropriate. It is important to remember that children can be at different levels of social, cognitive, or moral development at the same time. Compared to their peers, they may be very advanced in one or two areas and lagging a bit behind in others. Feel free to support them, but try not to rescue them, because they need the struggle to achieve each new level or milestone in development.

For example, when an elementary school–aged child puts on a seatbelt every time she gets in the car or wears a helmet every time she rides a bike, it seems like she is making good decisions based on sound judgment. In reality, the child is following a well-established habit. Young kids fail to fully understand the importance of wearing a seatbelt or helmet in an accident, even though their parents explain that it is good for them. There is a difference between doing something out of habit and using good judgment.

Turing, whose philosophy was to minimize the amount of hardware by maximizing the use of software, described it as ‘in the American tradition of solving one’s difficulties by means of much equipment rather than by thought’.19 He was right, but did not appreciate that the average computer user could not think as well as he did, or that the cost of equipment would fall so dramatically, so that today any idiot can use a computer.

One way parents fall into the rescue trap is by telling them about mistakes they made as a kid, in hopes their own children won’t make the same ones. Adults have a lot of experience making mistakes and learning from them, which helps us to avoid doing the same thing again.

Reading books that are developmentally appropriate allows children to practice those essential thinking skills—even if that means the book is “easier.” If parents push the more difficult book because of the implication that their child is considered more advanced, the child will struggle with comprehension and can’t practice the problem solving that goes with reading.

Whether a situation is truly unfair or not, parents should never put their child in the victim role. Once a child feels he is the victim, he can stop taking responsibility and he feels that all problems are the fault of someone else. On the other hand, if parents guide their children in coping with the situation, then they get practice dealing with difficult interpersonal situations.

What Children Say • “If you don’t do this, I will get a bad grade and it will lower my whole GPA.” • “It is a group project and I am the only one working on it.” • “My teacher didn’t post it on the website until yesterday.” • “I had soccer practice so I forgot to check the website.” • “The teacher is really disorganized.” • “Nobody told me it was due tomorrow.” What Parents Say • “It’s just this once.” • “If I don’t do it, there will be a lot of drama at home tonight.” • “My child will hate me if I don’t.” • “My child was so panicked last night that he or she couldn’t finish the project, so I needed to help.” • “His teacher is horrible anyway.” Parents also tell us that it feels good when their child still needs them when they offer some way to save the day. They tell us that they feel involved in their children’s lives if they help their children in that way. When parents rescue their kids, there is typically an outpouring of gratitude. Face it, how often does that occur, especially with teens? It is understandable that parents are so easily lured into the trap.

When a text is sent, the assumption is that it will only be read by the intended recipient. However, teens commonly share texts with others, resulting in it being read by an audience. When kids send hundreds of texts a day, rather than speaking directly to people, they simply are not practicing the skill of reading the crowd and responding accordingly.

Review your family rules about sharing information online and find out what personal information they have shared. The only information kids should share would be first name (many kids just use a gamer name), and general place of residence (Southern California, New York, Italy, etc.). They need to know never to give a last name, address, phone number, or places they go to hang out. • Ask them how they “met” their new online friends, what they know about them, and how they learned that information. • We suggest reviewing your child’s online profile and any images she may have posted. It’s best to let your kids know you could be looking at any time. If anything seems suspicious or out of the ordinary, you need to investigate further to determine if your child can continue to be “friends” with the individual.

As children reach the age of youth sports, parents roll out many reasons for not signing up their children to play. One of the most common is that registering to play in a league is a big commitment in terms of time and money for something you don’t know if your child will even enjoy.

In many ways, society has reinforced the idea of thinking quickly. Starting in school, the first child to raise her hand gets to answer the teacher’s question, the first kid to the foursquare court gets to make the rules even if they are silly rules and poorly thought out. Parents need to be aware of this phenomenon and let their children know that in some situations taking their time and thinking about options is a good idea. Alternately, when they see the signs and symptoms of reckless drug or alcohol use, they need to react quickly and set limits. We discuss how parents can identify signs and set limits throughout this chapter.

Subtle Signs: In most cases, an abrupt change to a child’s behavior is generally rare, so you need to pay attention to gradual changes in behavior. Some of the most common early behavioral signs of drug and alcohol use include being unusually tired, excessively angry, and very secretive. Drug and alcohol use is associated with a decrease in motivation and being withdrawn from their usual friends and activities.

Managing Money A thirteen-year-old girl got her first cell phone. The phone was intended for emergencies and so she could communicate with her parents. Her parents set up a limited data and usage plan. After the first month, they saw that she went over her minutes and was texting her friends; therefore, they increased her plan to include unlimited texting and more minutes. They talked with their daughter and set strict limits on her data usage. Despite their instructions, she downloaded so many programs that she far surpassed her data usage plan.

These quantum waves are strikingly different from the classical waves from Figure 7.6: a classical wave that you’re surfing on is made of water and the thing which has a wavy shape is the water surface, but the thing which is wavy or cloudlike in a hydrogen atom isn’t water or any kind of substance at all: there’s only a single electron there, and what’s wavy is its wavefunction, the extent to which it is in different places.

The Collapse of Consensus In summary, Schrödinger altered the classical description of the world in two ways: The state is described not by positions and velocities of the particles, but by a wavefunction. The change of this state over time is described not by Newton’s or Einstein’s laws, but by the Schrödinger equation.

These discoveries by Schrödinger have been universally celebrated as among the most important achievements of the twentieth century, and they created a revolution in both physics and chemistry. But they also left people tearing their hair out in confusion: if things could be in several places at once, why did we never observe that (while sober)? This puzzle became known as the measurement problem (in physics, measurement and observation are synonyms). After much debate and discussion, Bohr and Heisenberg came up with a remarkably radical remedy that became known as the Copenhagen interpretation, which to this day is taught and advocated in most quantum-mechanics textbooks.

Parents in extreme poverty need many children for the reasons I set out earlier: for child labor but also to have extra children in case some children die. It is the countries with the highest child mortality rates, like Somalia, Chad, Mali, and Niger, where women have the most babies: between five and eight. Once parents see children survive, once the children are no longer needed for child labor, and once the women are educated and have information about and access to contraceptives, across cultures and religions both the men and the women instead start dreaming of having fewer, well-educated children.

It has negotiated huge contracts with pharmaceutical companies, in which the price is cut to the bare minimum in return for guaranteed long contracts. But when you have negotiated to the bottom price, you can’t get lower. That’s another slide-shaped curve.

Dental health, for example, gets worse as people move from Level 1 to Level 2, then improves again on Level 4. This is because people start to eat sweets as soon as they can afford them, but their governments cannot afford to prioritize preventive public education about tooth decay until Level 3. So poor teeth are an indicator of relative poverty on Level 4, but on Level 1 they may indicate the opposite.

Imagine that we have a shield, or attention filter, between the world and our brain. This attention filter protects us against the noise of the world: without it, we would constantly be bombarded with so much information we would be overloaded and paralyzed. Then imagine that the attention filter has ten instinct-shaped holes in it—gap, negativity, straight line, and so on. Most information doesn’t get through, but the holes do allow through information that appeals to our dramatic instincts. So we end up paying attention to information that fits our dramatic instincts, and ignoring information that does not. The media can’t waste time on stories that won’t pass our attention filters.

Back in the 1930s, flying was really dangerous and passengers were scared away by the many accidents. Flight authorities across the world had understood the potential of commercial passenger air traffic, but they also realized flying had to become safer before most people would dare to try it. In 1944 they all met in Chicago to agree on common rules and signed a contract with a very important Annex 13: a common form for incident reports, which they agreed to share, so they could all learn from each other’s mistakes. Since then, every crash or incident involving a commercial passenger airplane has been investigated and reported; risk factors have been systematically identified; and improved safety procedures have been adopted, worldwide. Wow! I’d say the Chicago Convention is one of humanity’s most impressive collaborations ever. It’s amazing how well people can work together when they share the same fears. The fear instinct is so strong that it can make people collaborate across the world, to make the greatest progress. It’s so strong it can also remove 40 million noncrashing aircraft from our field of sight each year. Just like it can erase 330,000 child deaths from diarrhea from our TV screens. Just like that.

Chemophobia also means that every six months there is a “new scientific finding” about a synthetic chemical found in regular food in very low quantities that, if you ate a cargo ship or two of it every day for three years, could kill you. At this point, highly educated people put on their worried faces and discuss it over a glass of red wine. The zero-death toll seems to be of no interest in these discussions. The level of fear seems entirely driven by the “chemical” nature of the invisible substance.

incorrectly. To control the generalization instinct, question your categories. • Look for differences within groups. Especially when the groups are large, look for ways to split them into smaller, more precise categories. And … • Look for similarities across groups. If you find striking similarities between different groups, consider whether your categories are relevant. But also … • Look for differences across groups. Do not assume that what applies for one group (e.g., you and other people living on Level 4 or unconscious soldiers) applies for another (e.g., people not living on Level 4 or sleeping babies). • Beware of “the majority.” The majority just means more than half. Ask whether it means 51 percent, 99 percent, or something in between. • Beware of vivid examples. Vivid images are easier to recall but they might be the exception rather than the rule. • Assume people are not idiots. When something looks strange, be curious and humble, and think, In what way is this a smart solution?

To control the single perspective instinct, get a toolbox, not a hammer. • Test your ideas. Don’t only collect examples that show how excellent your favorite ideas are. Have people who disagree with you test your ideas and find their weaknesses. • Limited expertise. Don’t claim expertise beyond your field: be humble about what you don’t know. Be aware too of the limits of the expertise of others. • Hammers and nails. If you are good with a tool, you may want to use it too often. If you have analyzed a problem in depth, you can end up exaggerating the importance of that problem or of your solution. Remember that no one tool is good for everything. If your favorite idea is a hammer, look for colleagues with screwdrivers, wrenches, and tape measures. Be open to ideas from other fields. • Numbers, but not only numbers. The world cannot be understood without numbers, and it cannot be understood with numbers alone. Love numbers for what they tell you about real lives. • Beware of simple ideas and simple solutions. History is full of visionaries who used simple utopian visions to justify terrible actions. Welcome complexity. Combine ideas. Compromise. Solve problems on a case-by-case basis.

Perhaps they could not afford to fly? But we knew that the refugees were paying 1,000 euros for each place on a rubber dinghy. I went online and checked and there were plenty of tickets from Turkey to Sweden or from Libya to London for under 50 euros. Maybe they couldn’t reach the airport? Not true. Many of them were already in Turkey or Lebanon and could easily get to the airport. And they can afford a ticket, and the planes are not overbooked. But at the check-in counter, they are stopped by the airline staff from getting onto the plane. Why? Because of a European Council Directive from 2001 that tells member states how to combat illegal immigration. This directive says that every airline or ferry company that brings a person without proper documents into Europe must pay all the costs of returning that person to their country of origin. Of course the directive also says that it doesn’t apply to refugees who want to come to Europe based on their rights to asylum under the Geneva Convention, only to illegal immigrants. But that claim is meaningless. Because how should someone at the check-in desk at an airline be able to work out in 45 seconds whether someone is a refugee or is not a refugee according to the Geneva Convention? Something that would take the embassy at least eight months? It is impossible.

Why, then, must they come in such terrible boats? Actually, EU policy is behind that as well, because it is EU policy to confiscate the boats when they arrive. So boats can be used for one trip only. The smugglers could not afford to send the refugees in safe boats, like the fishing boats that brought 7,220 Jewish refugees from Denmark to Sweden over a few days in 1943, even if they wanted to.

Our European governments claim to be honoring the Geneva Convention that entitles a refugee from a severely war-torn country to apply for and receive asylum. But their immigration policies make a mockery of this claim in practice and directly create the transport market in which the smugglers operate. There is nothing secret about this; in fact it takes some pretty blurry or blocked thinking not to see it.

Blame and Claim The blame instinct drives us to attribute more power and influence to individuals than they deserve, for bad or good. Political leaders and CEOs in particular often claim they are more powerful than they are. Powerful Leaders? For example, Mao was undoubtedly an extraordinarily powerful figure whose actions had direct consequences for 1 billion people. But his infamous one-child policy had less influence on birth rates than is commonly thought.

We should also give more credit to two kinds of systems when things go right. The invisible actors behind most human success are prosaic and dull compared to great, all-powerful leaders. Nevertheless I want to praise them, so let’s throw a parade for the unsung heroes of global development: institutions and technology. Institutions Only in a few countries, with exceptionally destructive leaders and conflicts, has social and economic development been halted. Everywhere else, even with the most incapable presidents imaginable, there has been progress. It must make one ask if the leaders are that important. And the answer, probably, is no. It’s the people, the many, who build a society. Sometimes, when I turn the water on to wash my face in the morning and warm water comes out just like magic, I silently praise those who made it possible: the plumbers. When I’m in that mode I’m often overwhelmed by the number of opportunities I have to feel grateful to civil servants, nurses, teachers, lawyers, police officers, firefighters, electricians, accountants, and receptionists. These are the people building societies. These are the invisible people working in a web of related services that make up society’s institutions. These are the people we

In fact, resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face.

To control the blame instinct, resist finding a scapegoat. • Look for causes, not villains. When something goes wrong don’t look for an individual or a group to blame. Accept that bad things can happen without anyone intending them to. Instead spend your energy on understanding the multiple interacting causes, or system, that created the situation. • Look for systems, not heroes. When someone claims to have caused something good, ask whether the outcome might have happened anyway, even if that individual had done nothing. Give the system some credit.

But the future is always uncertain to some degree. And whenever we talk about the future we should be open and clear about the level of uncertainty involved. We should not pick the most dramatic estimates and show a worst-case scenario as if it were certain. People would find out! We should ideally show a mid-forecast, and also a range of alternative possibilities, from best to worst. If we have to round the numbers we should round to our own disadvantage. This protects our reputations and means we never give people a reason to stop listening.

Financial Collapse In a globalized world, the consequences of financial bubbles are devastating. They can crash the economies of entire countries and put huge numbers of people out of work, creating disgruntled citizens looking for radical solutions. A really large bank collapse could be way worse than the global eruption that started with the US housing loan crash in 2009. It could crash the entire global economy. Since even the best economists in the world failed to predict the last crash and fail year on year to predict the recovery from it—because the system is too complicated for accurate predictions—there is no reason to suppose that because no one is predicting a crash, it will not happen.

Being humble, here, means being aware of how difficult your instincts can make it to get the facts right. It means being realistic about the extent of your knowledge. It means being happy to say “I don’t know.” It also means, when you do have an opinion, being prepared to change it when you discover new facts. It is quite relaxing being humble, because it means you can stop feeling pressured to have a view about everything, and stop feeling you must be ready to defend your views all the time.

The detox phenomenon is interesting because it represents one of the most grandiose innovations of marketers, lifestyle gurus, and alternative therapists: the invention of a whole new physiological process. In terms of basic human biochemistry, detox is a meaningless concept. It doesn’t cleave nature at the joints. There is nothing on the ‘detox system’ in a medical textbook.

there should be no mystery here. Firstly, you want your expensive cream to hydrate your skin. They all do that, and Vaseline does the job very well: in fact, much of the important early cosmetics research was about preserving the moisturising properties of Vaseline, while avoiding its greasiness, and this technical mountain was scaled several decades ago. Hydrobase, at around £10 for a half-litre tub from your chemist, will do the job excellently.

imagine it would oxygenate your skin. Even if we give them the benefit of the doubt and pretend that these treatments really will deliver oxygen to the surface of the skin, and that this will penetrate meaningfully into the cells, what good would that do? Your body is constantly monitoring the amount of blood and nutrients it’s supplying to tissues, and the quantity of tiny capillary arteries feeding a given area, and more vessels will grow towards areas with low oxygen, because that is a good index of whether more blood supply is needed. Even if the claim about oxygen in cream penetrating your tissues were true, your body would simply downregulate the supply of blood to that part of skin, scoring a homeostatic own goal.

Giving out chemicals and herbs could be a dangerous business, since they can have genuine effects on the body (they induce symptoms, as Hahnemann identified). But he solved that problem with his second great inspiration, and the key feature of homeopathy that most people would recognise today: he decided—again, that’s the only word for it—that if you diluted a substance, this would ‘potentise’ its ability to cure symptoms, ‘enhancing’ its ‘spirit-like medicinal powers’, and at the same time, as luck would have it, also reducing its side-effects. In fact he went further than this: the more you dilute a substance, the more powerful it becomes at treating the symptoms it would otherwise induce.

Hahnemann professed, and indeed recommended, complete ignorance of the physiological processes going on inside the body: he treated it as a black box, with medicines going in and effects coming out, and championed only empirical data, the effects of the medicine on symptoms (‘The totality of symptoms and circumstances observed in each individual case,’ he said, ‘is the one and only indication that can lead us to the choice of the remedy’).
