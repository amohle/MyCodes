The teaching of mathematics in France was dominated by a handful of dogmatic mathematicians hiding behind the pseudonym “Bourbaki”, named after the 19th-century French general, Nicholas Bourbaki. It was an inside joke. The name appealed to the members because it sounded strange and attractive. Although Bourbaki met in secret, they influenced mathematical thinking, not just in France, but throughout Europe

It’s helpful to think of these four parameters — a, b, c, T — as four knobs we can turn to adjust various features of the sine wave’s shape and location. The b-knob moves the sine wave up or down. The c-knob moves it left or right. The T-knob controls how rapidly it oscillates. And the a-knob determines how pronounced those oscillations are. If we could somehow set the knobs to make the sine wave go through

With them, he could do integrals, find roots of algebraic equations, and calculate the values of non-algebraic functions like sines, cosines, and logarithms.

Punching in 2.001 and hitting the x3 button gives (2.001)3 = 8.012006001. The structure to notice is that the extra bit after the decimal point is really three extra bits of very different sizes: .012006001 = .012 + .000006 + .000000001. Think of this as small plus super-small plus super-super-small. We can understand the structure we’re seeing by working with algebra. Suppose a quantity x (played here by the number 2) changes slightly to x + Δx (in this case, becoming 2.001). The symbol Δx denotes the difference in x, meaning a tiny change in x (here, Δx = 0.001). Then, when we ask what (2.001)3 is, we are really asking what (x + Δx)3 is. Multiplying it out (or using Pascal’s triangle or the binomial theorem), we find that (x + Δx)3 = x3 + 3x2Δx + 3x(Δx)2 + (Δx)3. For our problem where x = 2, this equation becomes (2 + Δx)3 = 23 + 3(2)2(Δx) + 3(2)(Δx)2 + (Δx)3 = 8 + 12Δx + 6(Δx)2 + (Δx)3. Now we see why the extra bit beyond 8 consists of three bits of different sizes. The small but dominant bit is 12Δx = 12(.001) = .012. The remaining bits 6(Δx)2 and (Δx)3 account for the super-small .000006 and the super-super-small .000000001. The more factors of Δx there are in a bit, the smaller it is. That’s why the bits are graded in size. Every additional multiplication by the tiny factor Δx makes a small bit even smaller. The key insight behind differential calculus is displayed right here in this humble example. In many problems of cause and effect, dose and response, input and output, or any other sort of relationship

approaches zero. But what is it in terms of differentials? It’s simply dy/dx. It’s as if the curve is made up of little straight pieces: If we think of dy as an infinitesimal rise and dx as an infinitesimal run, the slope is simply the rise over the run, just as it always is, and hence is dy/dx. To apply this approach to a specific curve (say y = x3, the case we considered while cubing numbers slightly greater than 2), we calculate dy as follows.

When Isaac Newton explained the elliptical orbits of the planets and when Katherine Johnson calculated the trajectory of John Glenn’s space capsule, they were both solving a class of differential equations known as ordinary differential equations. The word ordinary is not meant to be pejorative. It’s the term of art for differential equations that depend on just one independent variable.

Partial differential equations are much richer than ordinary differential equations. They describe continuous systems moving and changing in space and time simultaneously or in two or more dimensions of space. Along with a cooling bowl of soup, the saggy shape of a hammock is described by such an equation. So is the spreading of a pollutant in a lake or the flow of air over the wing of a fighter plane.

When we started to work on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos, everything was in such a hurry that it wasn’t really ready. All the secrets of the project—everything about the atomic bomb—were kept in filing cabinets which, if they had locks at all, were locked with padlocks which had maybe only three pins: they were as easy as pie to open.

Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.22 It wasn’t the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.

Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

Nature is very clever; the air trapped by your finger in the straw will increase its volume just enough so that its pressure will decrease just the right amount (about 0.005 atmosphere) so that the pressure in the liquid in the straw at the same level of the surface of the liquid in the glass becomes the same: 1 atmosphere.

In addition to the Bernoulli lift there is a so-called reaction lift. B. C. Johnson describes this in detail in his delightful article “Aerodynamic Lift, Bernoulli Effect, Reaction Lift” (http://mb-soft.com/public2/lift.html). Reaction lift (named for Newton’s third law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) comes about when air passes underneath an airplane wing angled upward.

the “action.” That action must be met by an equal reaction of air pushing upward, so there is upward lift on the wing. In the case of a Boeing 747 (cruising at 550 miles per hour at an altitude of about 30,000 feet) more than 80 percent of the lift comes from reaction lift, and less than 20 percent from Bernoulli lift.

Your hand jiggles around quite a bit. In fact, it’s this difficulty in controlling reaction lift that accounts for why most airplane crashes occur close to takeoff and landing. The fraction of lift accounted for by reaction lift is higher at takeoff and landing than during flight at normal altitude. This is why when a big airliner lands, you can sometimes feel the plane wobble.

For the time being, we are only interested in the light that reflects just once. When the light exits the front of the drop, some of the light again refracts, separating the different colored rays still further.

The angle at which the red light exits can be anything between 0 degrees and 42 degrees but never more than 42 degrees, and this maximum angle is different for each of the

All raindrops at 42 degrees from the “imaginary line” will be red. Those at 40 degrees will be blue. raindrops at angles smaller than 40 degrees will be white (like the sunlight). We will see no light from drops at angles larger than 42 degrees (see text).

What about the blue band in the rainbow? Well, remember its magic number is just about 40 degrees, 2 degrees less than the red band. So blue light can be found refracting, reflecting, and refracting out of different raindrops at a maximum angle of 40 degrees.

The answer is that at the maximum angle for any given color, that color dominates all other colors. With red, though, because its angle is the highest, it is the only color.

when the Sun is low in the sky and when your shadow is long, then a rainbow may be enormous, reaching halfway up into the sky. Why halfway? Because the maximum angle it can be over the horizon is 42 degrees, or close to 45 degrees, which is half of the 90 degrees that would be right overhead.

If the waves are high enough and if they make lots of small water drops, these droplets act like raindrops and you can see two small pieces of the rainbow: one piece at about 42 degrees to the left of the imaginary line and a second piece about 42 degrees to the right.

If you’ve seen a double rainbow, you’ve probably noticed that the secondary bow is much fainter than the primary bow. You probably haven’t noticed, though, that the order of colors in the secondary bow is blue on the outside and red on the inside, the reverse of that in the primary.

In order to understand the origin of the secondary bow, we have to go back to our ideal raindrop—remember, of course, that it actually takes zillions of drops to make up a secondary rainbow as well. Some of the light rays entering the drops reflect just once; others reflect twice before exiting. While light rays entering any given raindrop can reflect many times inside it, the primary bow is only created by those that reflect once.

secondary bow, on the other hand, is created only by those that reflect twice inside before refracting on the way out. This extra bounce inside the raindrop is the reason the colors are reversed in the secondary bow.

You therefore need to look for the secondary bow about 10 degrees outside the primary bow. The reason that the secondary bow is much fainter is that so much less light reflects inside the raindrops twice than reflects once, so there’s less light to make the bow.

This was such a thrilling experience for the students that you might want to try it at home; making a glassbow is not too difficult. It does depend on what your objectives are. If you just want to see the colors of the bow, it’s quite easy. If you want to see the entire bow encircling your head it’s more work.

If you prefer to place the cardboard farther away, say 1.5 meters (5 feet), then you have to move the cardboard about 0.75 meters (2.5 feet) to see the colors of the bow. You may wonder how I arrived at these numbers. The reason is simple, the radius of a glassbow is about 28 degrees.

Then, through an almost absurdly complicated process, the eardrum vibrates the bones of the middle ear, known wonderfully as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, and they in turn produce waves in the fluid in the inner ear.

The Sun, for instance, with a temperature of about 6,000 kelvin at its surface, radiates a little less than half its energy (46 percent) in visible light. Most of the rest is in infrared (49 percent) and ultraviolet (5 percent) radiation. It’s nowhere near hot enough to emit X-rays. The Sun does emit some X-rays, the physics of which is not fully understood, but the energy emitted in X-rays is only about one-millionth of the total energy it emits. Your own body emits infrared radiation (see chapter 9); it’s not hot enough to emit visible light.

They also expected bremsstrahlung from the lunar surface due to the impact of electrons present in the solar wind. Since the Moon is so close, X-rays might be detectable.

-rays from deep space? Why? No one understood the finding. Before that flight we had known of exactly one star that emitted X-rays, our own Sun. And if the Sun had been 10 light-years away, say, which is really just around the corner in astronomical terms, the equipment in that historic flight was a million

times too insensitive to detect its X-rays. Everyone knew this. So wherever this source was located, it had to emit at least a million times more X-rays than the Sun—and that was only if it was really close by. Astronomical objects that produced (at least) a million or a billion times more X-rays than the Sun were literally unheard of. And there was no physics to describe such an object. In other words, it had to be a brand new kind of phenomenon in the heavens. A whole new field of science was born the night of June 18–19, 1962: X-ray astronomy.

But they were basically extending the reach of a centuries-old instrument, in a field dating back millennia. As X-ray astronomers, we were experiencing the dawn of a whole new scientific field. Who knew where it would lead, or what we would discover? We surely didn’t!

Our balloons carried our X-ray detectors to an altitude of about 145,000 feet (about 30 miles), where the atmospheric pressure is only 0.3 percent of that at sea level. When the atmosphere is this thin, a good fraction of X-rays with energies above 15 keV get through.

I remember in the 1960s and 1970s I would read every single paper that came out on X-ray astronomy. In 1974 I gave five lectures in Leiden (Oort was in my audience), and I was able to cover all of X-ray astronomy. Nowadays thousands of papers on X-ray astronomy are published every year, in a multitude of subfields, and no one can grasp the entire field.

The early years were the most fantastic years for me. They were also demanding, in just about every way: intellectually, physically, even logistically. Launching balloons was so complicated and expensive, time-consuming, and tension producing, I can hardly describe it. I’ll try, though.

you have to get the money to build equipment and pay students and sometimes to travel very far. Lots of what scientists really do is write grant proposals, in highly competitive programs, to get supported to do research.

The higher the energy of the X-rays, the stronger the light flashes. We used photomultipliers to detect the light flashes and convert them into electric pulses: the brighter the light flash, the higher the voltage of a pulse.

We knew that Sco X-1 emitted 99.9 percent of its energy in the form of X-rays, and that its X-ray luminosity was about 10,000 times the total luminosity of our Sun and about 10 billion times the X-ray luminosity of the Sun. For Sco X-1 to change its luminosity by a factor of four on a time scale of ten minutes—well, there was simply no physics to understand it.

possible to wrap a sheet of paper so that it fits snugly against a sphere, without folding it, stretching it, or tearing it. Geometry on a sphere is intrinsically different from geometry on a plane. For example, the Earth’s equator and the lines of longitude for 0° and 90° to its north determine a triangle that has three right angles and three equal sides (assuming the Earth to be a sphere). So Pythagoras’s equation is false.

A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements. It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations. For example, Aristotle’s theory that everything was made out of four elements, earth, air, fire, and water, was simple enough to qualify, but it did not make any definite predictions.

people feel that science should be concerned with only the first part; they regard the question of the initial situation as a matter for metaphysics or religion. They would say that God, being omnipotent, could have started the universe off any way he wanted. That may be so, but in that case he also could have made it develop in a completely arbitrary way. Yet it appears that he chose to make it evolve in a very regular way according to certain laws. It therefore seems equally reasonable to suppose that there are also laws governing the initial state.

Gravity is the weakest of the four forces by a long way; it is so weak that we would not notice it at all were it not for two special properties that it has: it can act over large distances, and it is always attractive.

addition to the photon, there were three other spin-1 particles, known collectively as massive vector bosons, that carried the weak force. These were called W+ (pronounced W plus), W− (pronounced W minus), and Z° (pronounced Z naught), and each had a mass of around 100 GeV

The strong nuclear force has a curious property called confinement: it always binds particles together into combinations that have no color. One cannot have a single quark on its own because it would have a color (red, green, or blue). Instead, a red quark has to be joined to a green and a blue quark by a ‘string’ of gluons

The success of the unification of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces led to a number of attempts to combine these two forces with the strong nuclear force into what is called a grand unified theory (or GUT).

The basic idea of GUTs is as follows: as was mentioned above, the strong nuclear force gets weaker at high energies. On the other hand, the electromagnetic and weak forces, which are not asymptotically free, get stronger at high energies. At some very high energy, called the grand unification energy, these three forces would all have the same strength and so could just be different aspects of a single force.

The EM spectrum refers to all the possible wavelengths of radiation existing in nature. Different-sized waves have different properties and are generated by different physical processes. Furthermore, they must be detected by completely different equipment. The invisible radiation coming from stars and galaxies (in addition to the visible or optical band) gives useful information, though it can’t be seen with the unaided eye.

The “stop, drop, and breathe” process assumes that you can calm yourself quickly enough to try a do-over of whatever pushed your buttons. But when your body goes into fight-or-flight, you’re pumped full of neurochemicals telling you to attack. Your child looks like the enemy, and you feel an urgent need to “set him straight.” But it doesn’t take the body an hour to calm down, unless you encountered a tiger. Seriously. Whatever your child did, it really was not an emergency. If it’s taking more than a few minutes to calm down, it’s because you haven’t told your body it was a false alarm. Your body is still in fight-or-flight. And your mind is still on the warpath, so it takes an hour to “distract” it.

Then, hand your kid the mom and play out the scenario again, with you being the kid. Make it funny so you can both giggle and let off tension. Make sure to include scenarios in which the kid goes to school in his PJs, or the mom goes to work in her PJs, or the kid has to yell at the mom to hurry up and get ready, or the mom says

Don’t start talking until you have your child’s attention. Get down on your child’s level and touch him lightly. Look him in the eye. Wait until he looks up. Then start talking. If you can’t do this for some reason—for example, if you’re in the car—make sure you have his attention by asking, “Can I tell you something?”

You can help your child with her anger by remembering that an angry child is showing you that she’s scared, disconnected, and hurting inside. Your job is to acknowledge both the anger and the emotions underneath it. Once children have a chance to feel the vulnerable feelings they’ve been avoiding, they no longer need the anger as a defense, and it melts away.

Then, about 1907, one of the more imaginative, perhaps even iconoclastic, of the classical physicists moved to centre stage. Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), a former student of Thomson’s at Cambridge, was by this time professor of physics at the University of Manchester and working in the new research area of radioactivity.

Have you ever had to tell apart a raw egg and a boiled egg, without taking their shells off? There’s an easy way to do it. Put the egg down on a smooth, hard surface and set it spinning. After a few seconds, briefly touch the outside of the shell with one finger, just enough to stop the egg’s rotation. The egg might just sit there, stationary. But after a second or two, it might slowly start to spin again. Raw and boiled eggs look the same on the outside, but their insides are different and that gives the secret away. When you touched the cooked egg, you stopped a whole solid object. But when you stopped the raw egg, you only stopped the shell.

The most precious treasure the whale carries down into the gloom is oxygen, needed to sustain the chemical reactions that power the swimming muscles, and the whale’s very life. But the gaseous oxygen supplied by the atmosphere becomes a liability in the deep – in fact, as soon as the whale leaves the surface, the air in its lungs becomes a problem. For every additional metre it swims downwards, the weight of one extra metre of water presses inwards. Nitrogen and oxygen molecules are bouncing off each other and the lung walls, and each collision provides a minuscule push. At the surface, the inward and outward pushes on the whale balance. But as the giant sinks, it is squashed by the additional weight of the water above it, and the push of the outside overwhelms the push from the inside. So the walls of the lungs move inwards until equilibrium, the point where the pushes are balanced once again.

On Earth, there is a limit to what gravity can do to you. That’s because you are only accelerated by the overall force on you, called the resultant force. As you speed up, you have to push more air out of the way in a given period of time, and that air also pushes back on you, effectively reducing the pull of gravity because it’s pushing in the opposite direction. At some point, those two things balance, and you will travel at your terminal velocity, unable to get any faster.

Buoyancy can be a very useful and quick indicator of what’s inside a sealed object. For example, if you take identically sized cans of a fizzy drink, one diet version and one with a full load of sugar, you’ll see that the diet can floats in fresh water and the other one sinks. The cans have exactly the same volume, so the difference is all inside, and it’s all that dense sugar. A standard 330 ml can of pop has 35–50 g of sugar inside it, and that extra mass counts, making the can overall more dense than water.

If your parents used spanking as a discipline method growing up, you may have reconciled yourself to their behavior by justifying it. You may even think there is no other choice for managing children who are “a handful.” I often hear “I got hit when I was a kid and I turned out okay,” or “I was spanked as a child, and I deserved it.” It’s very hard for us to believe that people who loved us would intentionally hurt us

Setting limits is an essential part of parenting. Limits keep our children safe and healthy and support them in learning social norms so that they can function happily in society. And if we set limits empathically, kids are more likely to internalize the ability to set limits for themselves, which is otherwise known as self-discipline.

The most common reason that children test the limits is that they really want to find out where those limits are. Children need the security of knowing that someone more experienced and knowledgeable is looking out for them.

So back in 2007, I started to read self-help books and discovered affirmations. You create a statement that encapsulates what you want to be and then repeat it to yourself. It’s a way to change a mindset that then allows you to take steps towards achieving a specific goal. My affirmation was “I am creative, I am an author.” I felt neither of those things and I couldn’t say it out loud for a while, but I kept repeating it and eventually started saying it out loud. Telling myself “I am creative” somehow released a block in me and enabled me to start creating and exploring.

Never interrupt a happily engaged baby. Okay, there may be times when you must. But in general, when a baby or child is focused on something, he’s working. Interrupting him is disrespectful, implying that what he was doing isn’t important. It keeps him from solving that particular problem, at least for now, but more importantly it interferes with his concentration and “attention span” muscle building. This is how he learns to play by himself, which you’ll be very happy about when he’s three.

Since the investor had no funds to repay the loan, both the broker and the investor had no profit to show for it.

To most serious meteorologists, forecasting was less than science. It was a seat-of–the-pants business performed by technicians who needed some intuitive ability to read the next day’s weather in the instruments and the clouds. It was guesswork. At centers like M.I.T., meteorology favored problems that had solutions. Lorenz understood the messiness of weather prediction as well as anyone, having tried it firsthand for the benefit of military pilots, but he harbored an interest in the problem—a mathematical interest.

Lorenz never was the type to shout Eureka. Serendipity merely led him to a place he had been all along. He was ready to explore the consequences of his discovery by working out what it must mean for the way science understood flows in all kinds of fluids. Had he stopped with the Butterfly Effect, an image of predictability giving way to pure randomness, then Lorenz would have produced no more than a piece of very bad news. But Lorenz saw more than randomness embedded in his weather model. He saw a fine geometrical structure, order masquerading as randomness. He was a mathematician in meteorologist’s clothing, after all, and now he began to lead a double life. He would write papers that were pure meteorology. But he would also write papers that were pure mathematics, with a slightly misleading dose of weather talk as preface. Eventually the prefaces would disappear altogether

Nature is full of others: animal populations that rise and fall almost regularly, epidemics that come and go on tantalizingly near-regular schedules.

His colleagues were astonished that Lorenz had mimicked both aperiodicity and sensitive dependence on initial conditions in his toy version of the weather: twelve equations, calculated over and over again with ruthless mechanical efficiency. How could such richness, such unpredictability—such chaos—arise from a simple deterministic system? L ORENZ PUT THE WEATHER ASIDE and looked for even simpler ways to produce this complex behavior. He found one in a system of just three equations. They were nonlinear, meaning that they expressed relationships that were not strictly proportional. Linear relationships can be captured with a straight line on a graph. Linear relationships are easy to think about: the more the merrier

The story of the computer over the past fifty-plus years has been painted as one of exponential growth year after year—referencing, in part, the famously accurate “Moore’s Law” prediction, made by Intel’s Gordon Moore in 1975, that the number of transistors in CPUs would double every two years. What hasn’t improved at that rate is the performance of memory, which means that relative to processing time, the cost of accessing memory is also increasing exponentially.

Bélády compared Random Eviction, FIFO, and variants of LRU in a number of scenarios and found that LRU consistently performed the closest to clairvoyance. The LRU principle is effective because of something computer scientists call “temporal locality”: if a program has called for a particular piece of information once, it’s likely to do so again in the near future.

Humans clearly have context-switching costs too. We feel them when we move papers on and off our desk, close and open documents on our computer, walk into a room without remembering what had sent us there, or simply say out loud, “Now, where was I?” or “What was I saying?” Psychologists have shown that for us, the effects of switching tasks can include both delays and errors—at the scale of minutes rather than microseconds. To put that figure in perspective, anyone you interrupt more than a few times an hour is in danger of doing no work at all.

To make things concrete, let’s say a friend shows you two different coins. One is a normal, “fair” coin with a 50–50 chance of heads and tails; the other is a two-headed coin. He drops them into a bag and then pulls one out at random. He flips it once: heads. Which coin do you think your friend flipped?

Once you know about overfitting, you see it everywhere. Overfitting, for instance, explains the irony of our palates. How can it be that the foods that taste best to us are broadly considered to be bad for our health, when the entire function of taste buds, evolutionarily speaking, is to prevent us from eating things that are bad? The answer is that taste is our body’s proxy metric for health. Fat, sugar, and salt are important nutrients, and for a couple hundred thousand years, being drawn to foods containing them was a reasonable measure for a sustaining diet. But being able to modify the foods available to us broke that relationship. We can now add fat and sugar to foods beyond amounts that

In machine learning, the advantages of moving slowly emerge most concretely in a regularization technique known as Early Stopping. When we looked at the German marriage survey data at the beginning of the chapter, we went straight to examining the best-fitted one-, two-, and ninefactor models. In many situations, however, tuning the parameters to find the best possible fit for given data is a process in and of itself. What happens if we stop that process early and simply don’t allow a model the time to become too complex? Again, what might seem at first blush like being halfhearted or unthorough emerges, instead, as an important strategy in its own right.

considering questions of profession or career, we ask questions like What would you do if you won the lottery? or, taking a different tack, What would you do if all jobs paid the same? The idea behind such thought exercises is exactly that of Constraint Relaxation: to make the intractable tractable, to make progress in an idealized world that can be ported back to the real one. If you can’t solve the problem in front of you, solve an easier version of it—and then see if that solution offers you a starting point, or a beacon, in the full-blown problem. Maybe it does.

Once the engines cut and you’re in orbit, the shuttle’s no longer accelerating. Your perception is that you’ve come to a complete stop. You’re moving at 17,500 miles per hour, but your inner ear is telling your brain that you’re perfectly still; your vestibular system works on gravity, and without any gravity signals coming in, the system thinks you’re not moving. So you have this sensation like you’re lurching forward but then you come to a stop when the engines cut. You feel like you’re sitting straight up in a dining room chair, except that you’re still strapped down flat on your back.

he talked about his days as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California, flying the X-15, the hypersonic rocket plane that set speed and altitude records in the 1960s by flying 50 miles above the Earth, the outer limit of the atmosphere, the edge of space. That was how Neil Armstrong thought of himself: as a pilot. Not as the first man to walk on the moon, but as a guy who loved to fly cool planes and was grateful for the opportunity to have done it.

I was glued to the television. Watching Neil Armstrong take those first lunar steps completely blew my mind. But seeing it on TV almost made it seem normal, like it could have been any old TV show. Going outside afterward made me think about how incredible it was. I remember standing in my front yard and staring up at the moon for the longest time, thinking, Wow, there are people up there, walking around. To a six-year-old kid in the suburbs on Long Island, it was the most awe-inspiring thing in the world. Something about it grabbed me down deep in my soul.

One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate

Much of this evolution is driven by economics and national policy, rather than by performance considerations. In order to understand today’s Internet network structure, let’s incrementally build a series of network structures, with each new structure being a better approximation of the complex Internet that we have today.

Now if some company builds and operates a global transit ISP that is profitable, then it is natural for other companies to build their own global transit ISPs and compete with the original global transit ISP. This leads to Network Structure 2, which consists of the hundreds of thousands of access ISPs and multiple global transit ISPs. The access ISPs certainly prefer Network Structure 2 over Network Structure 1 since they can now choose among the competing global transit providers as a function of their pricing and services.

Each regional ISP then connects to tier-1 ISPs. Tier-1 ISPs are similar to our (imaginary) global transit ISP; but tier-1 ISPs, which actually do exist, do not have a presence in every city in the world. There are approximately a dozen tier-1 ISPs, including Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT.

To build a network that more closely resembles today’s Internet, we must add points of presence (PoPs), multi-homing, peering, and Internet exchange points (IXPs) to the hierarchical Network Structure 3. PoPs exist in all levels of the hierarchy, except for the bottom (access ISP) level. A PoP is simply a group of one or more routers (at the same location) in the provider’s network where customer ISPs can connect into the provider ISP.

To reduce these costs, a pair of nearby ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy can peer, that is, they can directly connect their networks together so that all the traffic between them passes over the direct connection rather than through upstream intermediaries. When two ISPs peer, it is typically settlement-free, that is, neither ISP pays the other.

The most important of these delays are the nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propagation delay; together, these delays accumulate to give a total nodal delay. The performance of many Internet applications—such as search, Web browsing, e-mail, maps, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP—are greatly affected by network delays. In order to acquire a deep understanding of packet switching and computer networks, we must understand the nature and importance of these delays.

Assuming that packets are transmitted in a first-come-first-served manner, as is common in packetswitched networks, our packet can be transmitted only after all the packets that have arrived before it have been transmitted. Denote the length of the packet by L bits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to router B by R bits/sec. For example, for a 10 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R=10 Mbps; for a 100 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R=100 Mbps. The transmission delay is L/R. This is the amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into the link

difference between transmission delay and propagation delay. The difference is subtle but important. The transmission delay is the amount of time required for the router to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet’s length and the transmission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the distance between the two routers. The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit to propagate from one router to the next; it is a function of the distance between the two routers, but has nothing to do with the packet’s length or the transmission rate of the link

In VoIP, the sending side must first fill a packet with encoded digitized speech before passing the packet to the Internet. This time to fill a packet—called the packetization delay—can be significant and can impact the user-perceived quality of a VoIP call. This issue will be further explored in a homework problem at the end of this chapter.

A process is analogous to a house and its socket is analogous to its door. When a process wants to send a message to another process on another host, it shoves the message out its door (socket). This sending process assumes that there is a transportation infrastructure on the other side of its door that will transport the message to the door of the destination process. Once the message arrives at the destination host, the message passes through the receiving process’s door (socket), and the receiving process then acts on the message

It is important to note that the server sends requested files to clients without storing any state information about the client. If a particular client asks for the same object twice in a period of a few seconds, the server does not respond by saying that it just served the object to the client; instead, the server resends the object, as it has completely forgotten what it did earlier. Because an HTTP server maintains no information about the clients, HTTP is said to be a stateless protocol

Non-persistent connections have some shortcomings. First, a brand-new connection must be established and maintained for each requested object. For each of these connections, TCP buffers must be allocated and TCP variables must be kept in both the client and server. This can place a significant burden on the Web server, which may be serving requests from hundreds of different clients simultaneously. Second, as we just described, each object suffers a delivery delay of two RTTs—one RTT to establish the TCP connection and one RTT to request and receive an object. With HTTP 1.1 persistent connections, the server leaves the TCP connection open after sending a response. Subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server can be sent over the same connection. In particular, an entire Web page (in the example above, the base HTML file and the 10 images) can be sent over a single persistent TCP connection.

Now let’s look at the header lines in the example. The header line Host: www.someschool.edu specifies the host on which the object resides. You might think that this header line is unnecessary, as there is already a TCP connection in place to the host. But, as we’ll see in Section 2.2.5, the information provided by the host header line is required by Web proxy caches. By including the Connection: close header line, the browser is telling the server that it doesn’t want to bother with persistent connections; it wants the server to close the connection after sending the requested object.

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol. For example, hardware-implemented protocols in two physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the “wire” between the two network interface cards; congestion-control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver; protocols in routers determine a packet’s path from source to destination. Protocols are running everywhere in the Internet, and consequently much of this book is about computer network protocols.

Cable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems. As with a DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the home PC through an Ethernet port. (We will discuss Ethernet in great detail in Chapter 6.) At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM—turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format.

The DOCSIS 2.0 standard defines downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and upstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps. As in the case of DSL networks, the maximum achievable rate may not be realized due to lower contracted data rates or media impairments.

The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber, with one fiber leaving the CO for each home. More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers.

Store-and-Forward Transmission Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the links. Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. To explore store-and-forward transmission in more detail, consider a simple network consisting of two end systems connected by a single router, as shown in Figure 1.11. A router will typically have many incident links, since its job is to switch an incoming packet onto an outgoing link; in this simple example, the router has the rather simple task of transferring a packet from one (input) link to the only other attached link. In this example, the source has three packets, each consisting of L bits, to send to the destination. At the snapshot of time shown in Figure 1.11, the source has transmitted some of packet 1, and the front of packet 1 has already arrived at the router. Because the router employs store-and-forwarding, at this instant of time, the router cannot transmit the bits it has received; instead it must first buffer (i.e., “store”) the packet’s bits. Only after the router has received all of the packet’s bits can it begin to transmit (i.e., “forward”) the packet onto the outbound link.

The source begins to transmit at time 0; at time L/R seconds, the source has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire packet has been received and stored at the router (since there is no propagation delay). At time L/R seconds, since the router has just received the entire packet, it can begin to transmit the packet onto the outbound link towards the destination; at time 2L/R, the router has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire packet has been received by the destination. Thus, the total delay is 2L/R. If the Figure 1.11 Store-and-forward packet switching switch instead forwarded bits as soon as they arrive (without first receiving the entire packet), then the total delay would be L/R since bits are not held up at the router. But, as we will discuss in Section 1.4, routers need to receive, store, and process the entire packet before forwarding.

Thus, at time 2L/R, the destination has received the first packet and the router has received the second packet.

Let’s now consider the general case of sending one packet from source to destination over a path consisting of N links each of rate R (thus, there are N-1 routers between source and destination). Applying the same logic as above, we see that the end-to-end delay is: dend-to-end=NLR (1.1)

Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an Figure 1.12 Packet switching arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for transmission. In this case, packet loss will occur—either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped.

each router has a forwarding table that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router’s outbound links. When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link. The router then directs the packet to this outbound link. The end-to-end routing process is analogous to a car driver who does not use maps but instead prefers to ask for directions.

circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems. In packet-switched networks, these resources are not reserved; a session’s messages use the resources on demand and, as a consequence, may have to wait (that is, queue) for access to a communication link.

Note that the access ISP does not have to be a telco or a cable company; instead it can be, for example, a university (providing Internet access to students, staff, and faculty), or a company (providing access for its employees). But connecting end users and content providers into an access ISP is only a small piece of solving the puzzle of connecting the billions of end systems that make up the Internet. To complete this puzzle, the access ISPs themselves must be interconnected. This is done by creating a network of networks—understanding this phrase is the key to understanding the Internet. Over the years, the network of networks that forms the Internet has evolved into a very complex structure. Much of this evolution is driven by economics and national policy, rather than by performance considerations. In order to understand today’s Internet network structure, let’s incrementally build a series of network structures, with each new structure being a better approximation of the complex Internet that we have today.

One naive approach would be to have each access ISP directly connect with every other access ISP. Such a mesh design is, of course, much too costly for the access ISPs, as it would require each access ISP to have a separate communication link to each of the hundreds of thousands of other access ISPs all over the world.

Network Structure 2, just described, is a two-tier hierarchy with global transit providers residing at the top tier and access ISPs at the bottom tier. This assumes that global transit ISPs are not only capable of getting close to each and every access ISP, but also find it economically desirable to do so.

no ISP has presence in each and every city in the world. Instead, in any given region, there may be a regional ISP to which the access ISPs in the region connect. Each regional ISP then connects to tier-1 ISPs. Tier-1 ISPs are similar to our (imaginary) global transit ISP; but tier-1 ISPs, which actually do exist, do not have a presence in every city in the world. There are approximately a dozen tier-1 ISPs, including Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT.

Any ISP (except for tier-1 ISPs) may choose to multi-home, that is, to connect to two or more provider ISPs. So, for example, an access ISP may multi-home with two regional ISPs, or it may multi-home with two regional ISPs and also with a tier-1 ISP. Similarly, a regional ISP may multi-home with multiple tier-1 ISPs. When an ISP multi-homes, it can continue to send and receive packets into the Internet even if one of its providers has a failure.

We now finally arrive at Network Structure 5, which describes today’s Internet. Network Structure 5, illustrated in Figure 1.15, builds on top of Network Structure 4 by adding content-provider networks. Google is currently one of the leading examples of such a content-provider network. As of this writing, it is estimated that Google has 50–100 data centers distributed across North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia. Some of these data centers house over one hundred thousand servers, while other data centers are smaller, housing only hundreds of servers. The Google data centers are all interconnected via Google’s private TCP/IP network, which spans the entire globe but is nevertheless separate from the public Internet

Transmission Delay Assuming that packets are transmitted in a first-come-first-served manner, as is common in packetswitched networks, our packet can be transmitted only after all the packets that have arrived before it have been transmitted. Denote the length of the packet by L bits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to router B by R bits/sec. For example, for a 10 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R=10 Mbps; for a 100 Mbps Ethernet link, the rate is R=100 Mbps. The transmission delay is L/R. This is the amount of time required to push (that is, transmit) all of the packet’s bits into the link

Comparing Transmission and Propagation Delay Exploring propagation delay and transmission delay Newcomers to the field of computer networking sometimes have difficulty understanding the difference between transmission delay and propagation delay. The difference is subtle but important. The transmission delay is the amount of time required for the router to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet’s length and the transmission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the distance between the two routers. The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit to propagate from one router to the next; it is a function of the distance between the two routers, but has nothing to do with the packet’s length or the transmission rate of the link

An analogy might clarify the notions of transmission and propagation delay. Consider a highway that has a tollbooth every 100 kilometers, as shown in Figure 1.17. You can think of the highway segments between tollbooths as links and the tollbooths as routers. Suppose that cars travel (that is, propagate) on the highway at a rate of 100 km/hour (that is, when a car leaves a tollbooth, it instantaneously accelerates to 100 km/hour and maintains that speed between tollbooths). Suppose next that 10 cars, traveling together as a caravan, follow each other in a fixed order. You can think of each car as a bit and the caravan as a packet. Also suppose that each Figure 1.17 Caravan analogy tollbooth services (that is, transmits) a car at a rate of one car per 12 seconds, and that it is late at night so that the caravan’s cars are the only cars on the highway. Finally, suppose that whenever the first car of the caravan arrives at a tollbooth, it waits at the entrance until the other nine cars have arrived and lined up behind it. (Thus the entire caravan must be stored at the tollbooth before it can begin to be forwarded.) The time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the highway is (10 cars)/(5 cars/minute)=2 minutes. This time is analogous to the transmission delay in a router. The time required for a car to travel from the exit of one tollbooth to the next tollbooth is 100 km/(100 km/hour)=1 hour. This time is analogous to propagation delay.

Recall that R is the transmission rate; that is, it is the rate (in bits/sec) at which bits are pushed out of the queue. Also suppose, for simplicity, that all packets consist of L bits. Then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue is La bits/sec. Finally, assume that the queue is very big, so that it can hold essentially an infinite number of bits. The ratio La/R, called the traffic intensity, often plays an important role in estimating the extent of the queuing delay. If La/R > 1, then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue exceeds the rate at which the bits can be transmitted from the queue. In this unfortunate situation, the queue will tend to increase without bound

Packet Loss In our discussions above, we have assumed that the queue is capable of holding an infinite number of packets. In reality a queue preceding a link has finite capacity, although the queuing capacity greatly depends on the router design and cost. Because the queue capacity is finite, packet delays do not really approach infinity as the traffic intensity approaches 1. Instead, a packet can arrive to find a full queue. With no place to store such a packet, a router will drop that packet; that is, the packet will be lost. This overflow at a queue can again be seen in the Java applet for a queue when the traffic intensity is greater than 1. From an end-system viewpoint, a packet loss will look like a packet having been transmitted into the network core but never emerging from the network at the destination. The fraction of lost packets increases as the traffic intensity increases. Therefore, performance at a node is often measured not only in terms of delay, but also in terms of the probability of packet loss.

More specifically, suppose there are N−1 routers between the source and the destination. Then the source will send N special packets into the network, with each packet addressed to the ultimate destination. These N special packets are marked 1 through N, with the first packet marked 1 and the last packet marked N. When the nth router receives the nth packet marked n, the router does not forward the packet toward its destination, but instead sends a message back to the source. When the destination host receives the Nth packet, it too returns a message back to the source. The source records the time that elapses between when it sends a packet and when it receives the corresponding return message; it also records the name and address of the router (or the destination host) that returns the message. In this manner, the source can reconstruct the route taken by packets flowing from source to destination, and the source can determine the round-trip delays to all the intervening routers. Traceroute actually repeats the experiment just described three times, so the source actually sends 3 • N packets to the destination. RFC 1393 describes Traceroute in detail. Here is an example of the output of the Traceroute program, where the route was being traced from the source host gaia.cs.umass.edu (at the University of Massachusetts) to the host cis.poly.edu (at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn). The output has six columns: the first column is the n value described above, that is, the number of the router along the route; the second column is the name of the router; the third column is the address of the router (of the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx); the last three columns are the round-trip delays for three experiments. If the source receives fewer than three messages from any given router (due to packet loss in the network), Traceroute places an asterisk just after the router number and reports fewer than three round-trip times for that router. 1 cs-gw (128.119.240.254) 1.009 ms 0.899 ms 0.993 ms 2 128.119.3.154 (128.119.3.154) 0.931 ms 0.441 ms 0.651 ms 3 -border4-rt-gi-1-3.gw.umass.edu (128.119.2.194) 1.032 ms 0.484 ms 0.451 ms 4 -acr1-ge-2-1-0.Boston.cw.net (208.172.51.129) 10.006 ms 8.150 ms 8.460 ms 5 -agr4-loopback.NewYork.cw.net (206.24.194.104) 12.272 ms 14.344 ms 13.267 ms 6 -acr2-loopback.NewYork.cw.net (206.24.194.62) 13.225 ms 12.292 ms 12.148 ms 7 -pos10-2.core2.NewYork1.Level3.net (209.244.160.133) 12.218 ms 11.823 ms 11.793 ms 8 -gige9-1-52.hsipaccess1.NewYork1.Level3.net (64.159.17.39) 13.081 ms 11.556 ms 13.297 ms 9 -p0-0.polyu.bbnplanet.net (4.25.109.122) 12.716 ms 13.052 ms 12.786 ms 10 cis.poly.edu (128.238.32.126) 14.080 ms 13.035 ms 12.802 ms In the trace above there are nine routers between the source and the destination.

In VoIP, the sending side must first fill a packet with encoded digitized speech before passing the packet to the Internet. This time to fill a packet—called the packetization delay—can be significant and can impact the user-perceived quality of a VoIP call. This issue will be further explored in a homework problem at the end of this chapter.

1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks In addition to delay and packet loss, another critical performance measure in computer networks is endto-end throughput. To define throughput, consider transferring a large file from Host A to Host B across a computer network. This transfer might be, for example, a large video clip from one peer to another in a P2P file sharing system. The instantaneous throughput at any instant of time is the rate (in bits/sec) at which Host B is receiving the file.

the file consists of F bits and the transfer takes T seconds for Host B to receive all F bits, then the average throughput of the file transfer is F/T bits/sec. For some applications, such as Internet telephony, it is desirable to have a low delay and an instantaneous throughput consistently above some threshold (for example, over 24 kbps for some Internet telephony applications and over 256 kbps for some real-time video applications). For other applications, including those involving file transfers, delay is not critical, but it is desirable to have the highest possible throughput. To gain further insight into the important concept of throughput, let’s consider a few examples. Figure 1.19(a) shows two end systems, a server and a client, connected by two communication links and a router. Consider the throughput for a file transfer from the server to the client. Let R denote the rate of the link between the server and the router; and R denote the rate of the link between the router and the client.

Now suppose that all the links in the core of the communication network have very high transmission rates, much higher than R and R . Indeed, today, the core of the Internet is over-provisioned with high speed links that experience little congestion. Also suppose that the only bits being sent in the entire network are those from the server to the client. Because the core of the computer network is like a wide pipe in this example, the rate at which bits can flow from source to destination is again the minimum of R and R , that is, throughput = min{R , R }. Therefore, the constraining factor for throughput in today’s Internet is typically the access network.

Therefore, the constraining factor for throughput in today’s Internet is typically the access network. For a final example, consider Figure 1.20(b) in which there are 10 servers and 10 clients connected to the core of the computer network. In this example, there are 10 simultaneous downloads taking place, involving 10 client-server pairs. Suppose that these 10 downloads are the only traffic in the network at the current time. As shown in the figure, there is a link in the core that is traversed by all 10 downloads. Denote R for the transmission rate of this link R. Let’s suppose that all server access links have the same rate R , all client access links have the same rate R , and the transmission rates of all the links in the core—except the one common link of rate R—are much larger than R , R , and R. Now we ask, what are the throughputs of the downloads? Clearly, if the rate of the common link, R, is large—say a hundred times larger than both R and R —then the throughput for each download will once again be min{R , R }. But what if the rate of the common link is of the same order as R and R ? What will the throughput be in this case? Let’s take a look at a specific example. Suppose Rs=2 Mbps, Rc=1 Mbps, R=5 Mbps, and the Figure 1.20 End-to-end throughput: (a) Client downloads a file from server; (b) 10 clients downloading with 10 servers

A layered architecture allows us to discuss a well-defined, specific part of a large and complex system. This simplification itself is of considerable value by providing modularity, making it much easier to change the implementation of the service provided by the layer. As long as the layer provides the same service to the layer above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it, the remainder of the system remains unchanged when a layer’s implementation is changed.

As long as the layer provides the same service to the layer above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it, the remainder of the system remains unchanged when a layer’s implementation is changed. (Note that changing the implementation of a service is very different from changing the service itself!) For example, if the gate functions were changed (for instance, to have people board and disembark by height), the remainder of the airline system would remain unchanged since the gate layer still provides the same function (loading and unloading people); it simply implements that function in a different manner after the change.

Protocol layering has conceptual and structural advantages [RFC 3439]. As we have seen, layering provides a structured way to discuss system components. Modularity makes it easier to update system components. We mention, however, that some researchers and networking engineers are vehemently opposed to layering [Wakeman 1992]. One potential drawback of layering is that one layer may duplicate lower-layer functionality. For example, many protocol stacks provide error recovery

Application Layer The application layer is where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside. The Internet’s application layer includes many protocols, such as the HTTP protocol (which provides for Web document request and transfer), SMTP (which provides for the transfer of e-mail messages), and FTP (which provides for the transfer of files between two end systems). We’ll see that certain network functions, such as the translation of human-friendly names for Internet end systems like www.ietf.org to a 32-bit network address, are also done with the help of a specific application-layer protocol, namely, the domain name system (DNS)

Transport Layer The Internet’s transport layer transports application-layer messages between application endpoints. In the Internet there are two transport protocols, TCP and UDP, either of which can transport applicationlayer messages. TCP provides a connection-oriented service to its applications. This service includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control (that is, sender/receiver speed matching). TCP also breaks long messages into shorter segments and provides a congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles its transmission rate when the network is congested.

Network Layer The Internet’s network layer is responsible for moving network-layer packets known as datagrams from one host to another. The Internet transport-layer protocol (TCP or UDP) in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address to the network layer, just as you would give the postal service a letter with a destination address. The network layer then provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer in the destination host.

Link Layer The Internet’s network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination. To move a packet from one node (host or router) to the next node in the route, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer. In particular, at each node, the network layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route. At this next node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the network layer. The services provided by the link layer depend on the specific link-layer protocol that is employed over the link. For example, some link-layer protocols provide reliable delivery, from transmitting node, over one link, to receiving node.

Examples of link-layer protocols include Ethernet, WiFi, and the cable access network’s DOCSIS protocol. As datagrams typically need to traverse several links to travel from source to destination, a datagram may be handled by different link-layer protocols at different links along its route. For example, a datagram may be handled by Ethernet on one link and by PPP on the next link. The network layer will receive a different service from each of the different link-layer protocols. In this book, we’ll refer to the link-layer packets as frames.

Physical Layer While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one network element to an adjacent network element, the job of the physical layer is to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next. The protocols in this layer are again link dependent and further depend on the actual transmission medium of the link (for example, twisted-pair copper wire, single-mode fiber optics). For example, Ethernet has many physical-layer protocols: one for twisted-pair copper wire, another for coaxial cable, another for fiber, and so on. In each case, a bit is moved across the link in a different way.

1.5.2 Encapsulation Figure 1.24 shows the physical path that data takes down a sending end system’s protocol stack, up and down the protocol stacks of an intervening link-layer switch Figure 1.24 Hosts, routers, and link-layer switches; each contains a different set of layers, reflecting their differences in functionality and router, and then up the protocol stack at the receiving end system. As we discuss later in this book, routers and link-layer switches are both packet switches. Similar to end systems, routers and link-layer switches organize their networking hardware and software into layers. But routers and link-layer switches do not implement all of the layers in the protocol stack; they typically implement only the bottom layers. As shown in Figure 1.24, link-layer switches implement layers 1 and 2; routers implement layers 1 through 3. This means, for example, that Internet routers are capable of implementing the IP protocol (a layer 3 protocol), while link-layer switches are not.

We’ll see later that while link-layer switches do not recognize IP addresses, they are capable of recognizing layer 2 addresses, such as Ethernet addresses. Note that hosts implement all five layers; this is consistent with the view that the Internet architecture puts much of its complexity at the edges of the network. Figure 1.24 also illustrates the important concept of encapsulation. At the sending host, an application-layer message (M in Figure 1.24) is passed to the transport layer. In the simplest case, the transport layer takes the message and appends additional information (so-called transport-layer header information, H in Figure 1.24) that will be used by the receiver-side transport layer. The application-layer message and the transport-layer header information together constitute the transportlayer segment. The transport-layer segment thus encapsulates the application-layer message. The added information might include information allowing the receiver-side transport layer to deliver the message up to the appropriate application, and error-detection bits that allow the receiver to determine whether bits in the message have been changed in route. The transport layer then passes the segment to the network layer, which adds network-layer header information

The datagram is then passed to the link layer, which (of course!) will add its own link-layer header information and create a link-layer frame. Thus, we see that at each layer, a packet has two types of fields: header fields and a payload field. The payload is typically a packet from the layer above.
